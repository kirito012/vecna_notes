## Class Features

### Assassin (Level 3)

You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those who adhere to this archetype are diverseâ€”hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes with deadly efficiency.

Your archetype grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Assassinate (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is [surprised](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Surprised) is a critical hit.

### Bonus Proficiencies (Level 3)

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the [disguise kit](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/disguise-kit.md) and the [poisoner's kit](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/poisoners-kit.md).

### Infiltration Expertise (Level 9)

Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can't establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.

Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.

### Impostor (Level 13)

At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person's behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerism.

Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma ([Deception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check you make to avoid detection.

### Death Strike (Level 17)

Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is [surprised](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Surprised), it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.
