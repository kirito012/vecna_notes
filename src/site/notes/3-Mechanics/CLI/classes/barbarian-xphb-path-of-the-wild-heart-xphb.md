## Class Features

### Path of the Wild Heart (Level 3)

*Walk in Community with the Animal World*

Barbarians who follow the Path of the Wild Heart view themselves as kin to animals. These Barbarians learn magical means to communicate with animals, and their Rage heightens their connection to animals as it fills them with supernatural might.

### Animal Speaker (Level 3)

You can cast the [Beast Sense](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/beast-sense-xphb.md) and [Speak with Animals](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/speak-with-animals-xphb.md) spells but only as Rituals. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them.

### Rage of the Wilds (Level 3)

Your Rage taps into the primal power of animals. Whenever you activate your Rage, you gain one of the following options of your choice.

#### Bear

While your Rage is active, you have [Resistance](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to every damage type except Force, Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant.

#### Eagle

When you activate your Rage, you can take the [Disengage](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Disengage) and [Dash](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash) actions as part of that [Bonus Action](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md). While your Rage is active, you can take a [Bonus Action](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to take both of those actions.

#### Wolf

While your Rage is active, your allies have [Advantage](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against any enemy of yours within 5 feet of you.

### Aspect of the Wilds (Level 6)

You gain one of the following options of your choice. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md), you can change your choice.

#### Owl

You have [Darkvision](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) with a range of 60 feet. If you already have [Darkvision](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision), its range increases by 60 feet.

#### Panther

You have a [Climb Speed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/climb-speed-xphb.md) equal to your [Speed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md).

#### Salmon

You have a [Swim Speed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md) equal to your [Speed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md).

### Nature Speaker (Level 10)

You can cast the [Commune with Nature](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/commune-with-nature-xphb.md) spell but only as a [Ritual](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/ritual-xphb.md). Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.

### Power of the Wilds (Level 14)

Whenever you activate your Rage, you gain one of the following options of your choice.

#### Falcon

While your Rage is active, you have a [Fly Speed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb.md) equal to your [Speed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) if you aren't wearing any armor.

#### Lion

While your Rage is active, any of your enemies within 5 feet of you have [Disadvantage](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against targets other than you or another Barbarian who has this option active.

#### Ram

While your Rage is active, you can cause a Large or smaller creature to have the [Prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition when you hit it with a melee attack.
