# Appendix C: Secrets Tracker
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin* 

Use this chart to keep track of the secrets characters learn during this adventure. Since it contains spoilers, keep this sheet hidden from the players!

When the characters learn a valuable secret, check the "Secret Learned" box in the appropriate row. If the characters use the Power of Secrets rules (see the introduction) to spend a secret they've learned, or if they reveal a secret they've learned to a nonplayer character, mark a corresponding "Secret Revealed" box. The party's total "Secrets Kept"—equal to the number of Secrets Learned minus Secrets Revealed—can impact the characters' fight against Vecna in chapter 11.
