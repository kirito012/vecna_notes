# Chapter 2: The Wizards Three
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin* 

![Alustriel and Tasha desper...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/026-02-001-the-wizards-three.webp#center "Alustriel and Tasha desperately cast a Wish spell to try to stop Vecna's evil plan. Mordenkainen, who is Kas in disguise, secretly sabotages the spell")

Time has passed since the characters' experience in Neverdeath Graveyard. That ordeal might seem firmly in the past, but the characters receiving Vecna's Link is the harbinger of events none could predict. In this chapter, the characters become involved in three powerful wizards' desperate bid to stop the remaking of existence at the hands of the lich-god Vecna. The characters are soon led to believe that retrieving and reconstructing a legendary artifact is the only way to avoid a bleak future for the entire multiverse.

## Running This Chapter

This chapter begins sometime after the characters' adventure in Neverwinter—days, months, or years, at your discretion. After you and the players determine what the characters have been doing following their Neverwinter escapades, the heroes are abruptly shunted to a mysterious sanctum in Sigil, the city at the center of the multiverse (see the "Surprise Development" section later in this chapter).

The characters learn a sobering fact from the renowned wizards Alustriel Silverhand, Mordenkainen, and Tasha: the lich-god Vecna is planning to remake the multiverse and emerge as its most powerful being, subjugating all existence. Mordenkainen, who is actually the vampire Kas in disguise, believes the characters are the only ones who can stop Vecna's plans using the fabled [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md), pieces of which are scattered throughout the multiverse.

Alustriel, Mordenkainen, and Tasha aid the characters in their task. This quest leads the characters deep into the Underdark in Faerûn, where the first piece of the rod is hidden in Web's Edge, a secret haven for cultists of the demon-god Lolth.

### Character Advancement

The characters should be 11th level when this chapter begins. The characters gain a level after they retrieve the first piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) from Web's Edge in the Underdark.

### Power of Secrets

The characters can learn two secrets in this chapter or later that are applicable to the rules in "The Power of Secrets" section in this book's introduction:

- **Gertrude's Secret.** The characters can learn that Gertrude, the lone survivor of an ambushed caravan, and her friend Rockzanna knew about an imminent attack by Lolth's cultists but said nothing (see area W6a in Web's Edge).  
- **Mordenkainen's Secret.** Mordenkainen is duping Alustriel, Tasha, and the characters and is actually Kas in disguise. (The characters aren't likely to learn this until later in the adventure.)  

### First Rod Piece

The [first piece](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) is in area W12 of Web's Edge later in this chapter. For more information about the rod and the spell this piece allows its wielder to cast, see this book's introduction.

## After Neverdeath

It's up to you whether the events of this chapter happen after some time passes or immediately following the characters' experience in Neverdeath Graveyard. If you wish to emphasize urgency, this chapter's events happen a few days after the characters report their success to Lord Neverember in Neverwinter. If you'd rather emphasize the methodical nature of an eternal lich-god planning his dominance over the multiverse, months or years could pass before the characters arrive in Sigil.

### Vecna's Link

Before resolving how the characters spend the time between their Neverwinter adventure and the events of this chapter, reiterate that each character retains their Vecna's Link. At various times throughout the interim period, the characters are reminded that they're metaphysically linked to Vecna. However you narrate this, make it clear that there's something supernatural about this connection. The link can't be removed, and attempts to research the link are unsuccessful. The characters don't know it yet, but they'll soon learn that the link is a harbinger of events to come.

### During the Interim

If months or years pass before the characters meet the Wizards Three (see the "Surprise Development" section later in this chapter), ask the players what their characters did during this time. The party might have stayed together and gone on further adventures, or each character could have gone their own way.

If the players aren't sure or you'd like to offer them suggestions, consult the Interim Events table below. Choose your favorite result or roll randomly as you see fit.

**Interim Events**

`dice: [](03-chapter-2-the-wizards-three.md#^interim-events)`

| dice: d6 | Event |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Determined to find answers about what happened to them, the characters worked as protection for gravediggers in Neverdeath Graveyard. They fought undead, grave robbers, and sometimes even devils who served evil cultists. |
| 2 | Hoping to put their Neverwinter experiences behind them, the characters hopped on a ship to the Moonshae Isles and escorted traders around the Sword Coast area. They fought privateers and oceanic monsters in their bid for high adventure. |
| 3 | The characters became obsessed with the cult of Vecna, researching it in prominent libraries and memorizing historical accounts of its activities. As a result, they know everything the Wizards Three tell the party about Vecna except his attempts to re-create the multiverse. |
| 4 | Sobered by their experiences, the characters passed the time peacefully in the houses Lord Neverember granted them in Neverwinter. Adventure became less of a priority as they settled into domestic life. |
| 5 | Obsessed with the concept of the multiverse, the characters studied the realms that make up existence, traveling between them to learn more. As a result, they know everything the Wizards Three tell the party about the planes where the pieces of the rod are located. |
| 6 | Hoping to put their experiences behind them, the characters accepted a call for heroes to confront a murderous young red dragon named Rhagaermati in the wilds outside Myth Drannor. They are fighting the dragon when they experience the events described in the "Surprise Development" section. |{ #interim-events}


## Rise of the Lich-God

Regardless of the characters' activities after their Neverwinter adventure, key plots elements of this adventure progress in the background. While the characters live their lives, a powerful wizard and former ruler of the city of Silverymoon, [Alustriel Silverhand](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/alustriel-silverhand-veor.md), detects a sinister wave of magic rippling through the multiverse.

Using her divining abilities, Alustriel eventually traces the magical pulse to Vecna. She learns that Vecna's activities span multiple realms. After a period of investigation, Alustriel discovers the sobering truth: using stolen secrets, Vecna and his cults have siphoned incredible amounts of power from individuals throughout the multiverse. Worse, Alustriel eventually stops detecting these activities, leading the archmage to believe that Vecna plans to unleash this power for a heinous purpose. Alustriel realizes this could unravel the entire multiverse, elevating Vecna and cowing all others to his will.

### The Archmages' Desperation

Determined to oppose Vecna but unsure how the lich-god intends to unleash his amassed magic, Alustriel contacts her most powerful allies. Answering her call are the archmages Mordenkainen and a version of [Tasha](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tasha-the-witch-veor.md) from Oerth, though Alustriel and Tasha don't yet know that Mordenkainen is [Kas the Destroyer](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kas-the-betrayer-veor.md) in disguise. These Wizards Three retreat to a sanctum Alustriel keeps in Sigil. Using their combined magic, the archmages weave a [Wish](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell in hopes of sabotaging Vecna's accumulated power and defusing his ritual.

Instead of any expected effect, the *Wish* spell shunts the characters to Alustriel Silverhand's Sigil sanctum, as explained in the "Surprise Development" section later in this chapter. With time of the essence and the archmages weakened, Mordenkainen suggests a desperate contingency plan. The characters could use the fabled [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) to stop Vecna. The rod's seven pieces are scattered throughout the multiverse, but Mordenkainen knows where the first piece is located.

## The Sigil Sanctum

Hundreds of years ago, Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon needed a secure place to conduct sensitive magic work and research. After discovering a portal from Silverymoon to Sigil, Alustriel traveled to Sigil. There she spent decades creating a private sanctum around the portal.

Alustriel magically fused the portal in her sanctum with a [Well of Many Worlds](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/well-of-many-worlds.md), destroying the magic item in the process. As a result, the portal now leads to numerous locations throughout the multiverse. Further, the portal reacts to magic items and artifacts, allowing those who carry such objects to step through the portal to the exact places they wish to travel. Alustriel carefully maintains the sanctum's secrecy, bringing guests here only after first meeting them in a neutral location. So far, either her portal's strange teleportation properties have gone unnoticed by Sigil's Lady of Pain and her agents, or the Lady of Pain is allowing the portal to function this way for reasons of her own.

### Magic in the Sanctum

Planar magic functions differently in Sigil. For instance, the only way to reach Sigil is through portals; teleporting into or out of the city doesn't work. Since the characters might spend significant time in Sigil, take note of how the following types of magic work in the city:

![Lady Alustriel Silverhand](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/027-02-001-lady-alustriel-silverhand.webp#center)

- **Banishment.** Effects that banish a target from Sigil treat the target as if Sigil were its home plane.  
- **Extradimensional Space.** Extradimensional spaces, demiplanes, and pocket dimensions—such as those created by a [Bag of Holding](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bag-of-holding.md) or the [Rope Trick](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/rope-trick.md) spell—function within Sigil, but those spaces follow these restrictions as if they were part of the city.  
- **Planar Travel.** Effects that allow interplanar travel, such as the [Astral Projection](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/astral-projection.md) and [Plane Shift](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) spells, fail if used to try to enter or leave Sigil, with one exception (see "Teleportation Circles" below).  
- **Summoning.** Spells, magic items, and effects that summon creatures or objects from other planes, such as a [Ring of Djinni Summoning](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/ring-of-djinni-summoning.md), instead summon targets from within Sigil if possible or otherwise fail. Effects that summon a specific target from outside Sigil, such as the [Drawmij's Instant Summons](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/drawmijs-instant-summons.md) and [Leomund's Secret Chest](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/leomunds-secret-chest.md) spells, automatically fail.  
- **Teleportation.** Attempts to teleport into or out of Sigil fail, but such magic functions normally when teleporting within the city.  
- **Teleportation Circles.** Permanent teleportation circles exist within Sigil, but attempts to create new ones fail. If the Lady of Pain permits, they can be used to enter the city via the [Plane Shift](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) spell but not to leave.  

### General Features

The features of Alustriel's sanctum are described in the following sections.

#### Ceilings

The ceilings on the first floor of the sanctum are 20 feet high. The ceilings on the upper floor are 10 feet high.

#### Doors

No doors separate areas S1–S3 of the sanctum, though open archways set off each area. The doors in areas S5–S7 of the sanctum are unlocked. The door to area S8, Mordenkainen's room, is sealed with an [Arcane Lock](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/arcane-lock.md) spell that requires a successful DC 30 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check using thieves' tools to open.

#### Lighting

[Continual Flame](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/continual-flame.md) spells cast on sconces bathe most areas in bright light. Only area S8 is unlit.

#### Safe from Prying Eyes

Everyone in the sanctum is under the effect of a [Nondetection](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/nondetection.md) spell while they remain inside the structure.

#### Walls

Alustriel magically reinforced the walls of the sanctum, which are made of a combination of brick and layers of cement. Only exceedingly powerful destructive magic could harm the sanctum's structural integrity.

### Sanctum Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 2.1.

![Map 2.1: The Sanctum](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/028-map-2-01-the-sanctum.webp#center)

#### S1: Library

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Gleaming, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves filled with leather-bound tomes wrap around the sanctum's west end, while marble pillars hold up vaulted ceilings to the east. Spiral staircases in the corners lead upward.{ #0d5}


This section of the sanctum holds Alustriel's collection of rare books. The books aren't magical, but the characters can use them to research any esoteric topic.

If a character researches a specific topic, roll a `d4`. On a roll of 1 or 2, the character finds information about the topic. At your discretion, this might grant the character advantage for the rest of the day on any ability checks made to recall or use the information they've learned.

#### S2: Parlor

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Plush, antique furniture, including sofas and footstools, is arranged here. To the north is a grand staircase. To the south, a garden of ferns and flowering plants grows around a raised marble dais.{ #0d7}


When Alustriel invites dignitaries into her sanctum, she holds business and political discussions in this parlor. The grand staircase ascends to area S4.

##### Dais

The dais in the center of the garden is the site of the portal Alustriel has tweaked to lead to numerous multiplanar locations.

##### Garden

The greenery is the result of Alustriel's dabbling in magical gardening. The plants here need no tending.

![What mischief is Mordenkainen up to?](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/029-02-002-mordenkainen.webp#center)

#### S3: Workspace

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A desk covered in paperwork and books sits in the middle of this work area. Nearby are curio cabinets filled with magical trinkets—everything from necklaces and brooches to sparkling stones and shoes.{ #0db}


Characters transported to the sanctum by the failed [Wish](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell appear here (see the "Surprise Development" section later in this chapter).

##### Curio Cabinets

Alustriel keeps an impressive collection of magic items here. If the characters ask, Alustriel allows each character to borrow their choice of any single magic item of rare or lower rarity from the "Dungeon Master's Guide". Later in this chapter, Kas, disguised as Mordenkainen, retrieves the [Chime of Exile](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/chime-of-exile-veor.md) from one of these cabinets.

#### S4: Lounge

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Roaring fireplaces are built into the east and west walls of this lounge. Comfortable couches and chairs are artfully arranged before a grand staircase that leads downward.{ #0de}


Alustriel and her friends socialize, dine, and relax in this lounge. Alustriel is known for her sumptuous dinner parties. Discreet drawers in the bottoms of the couches store fine china and cutlery for when Alustriel transforms the center table into a dining table. Additional storage is in the northwest corner.

When the characters are shunted to the sanctum, Alustriel offers them use of the lounge.

#### S5–S8: Bedrooms

These small but comfortable bedrooms are where Alustriel and her guests stay when they need personal quarters, whether it's to sleep or be alone.

Area S5 is the bedroom of Alustriel and her wife, Malaina van Talstiv. A retired adventurer, Malaina is a neutral good human who uses the [assassin](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) stat block. Malaina is meeting with associates to thwart a scheme against Waterdeep when the characters arrive. When the characters return, Malaina speaks with them (see the "Next Steps" section at the end of this chapter).

Area S6 is Tasha's room. Area S7 is an empty room, which Alustriel offers to the characters for their use. Area S8 is Mordenkainen's bedroom, which contains clues hinting at subterfuge (see the "Evidence of Deception" section later in this chapter).

## The Wizards Three

Three legendary archmages serve as the characters' allies throughout the rest of this adventure, though one of these individuals is an impostor. (See the "Kas the Destroyer" section.) More information about each spellcaster follows.

### Alustriel Silverhand

More than seven centuries old, Lady [Alustriel Silverhand](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/alustriel-silverhand-veor.md) is beloved throughout Faerûn for her kindliness and for using her incredible spellcasting power to protect the innocent. Alustriel is an immortal daughter of Mystra, a god of magic, and is a chaotic good, human wizard. Alustriel served as High Mage of Silverymoon, battled demons on the Outer Planes, and prevented the lich Larloch from ascending to godhood. She has seen the rise and fall of evil powers, though Vecna's plot troubles her greatly. More about Alustriel, including her stat block, appears in appendix B.

### Mordenkainen

Renowned for his bravery but not his judgment, Mordenkainen is a powerful spellcaster from Oerth. The chaotic neutral, human wizard led a council of famous archmages known as the Circle of Eight. He later became trapped in the dread realm of Barovia, where he lost his spellbook and staff as well as his grip on reality and wandered adrift for some time. Alustriel trusts Mordenkainen and respects his gumption, even though he occasionally embarks on tasks that outstrip his capabilities. The real Mordenkainen doesn't appear in this adventure, though the characters likely believe they're interacting with him.

### Tasha

[Tasha](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/tasha-the-witch-veor.md) is a chaotic neutral archmage from Oerth, a renowned demonologist, and the adopted daughter of Baba Yaga. Tasha is widely considered the multiverse's foremost authority on the Abyss, having authored the fabled [Demonomicon of Iggwilv](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/demonomicon-of-iggwilv-tce.md). Although Tasha's motives are fickle, Alustriel has found Tasha an unparalleled ally when their interests align, as Tasha can access and influence places where even the daughter of Mystra dares not tread. The version of Tasha who answers Alustriel's summons is from the past, before Tasha became Iggwilv the Witch Queen. More about Tasha, including her stat block, can be found in appendix B.

![Tasha](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/030-02-003-tasha.webp#center)

## Kas the Destroyer

The vampire warlord [Kas](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kas-the-betrayer-veor.md) maintains his masquerade as Mordenkainen, likely fooling the characters until the events of chapter 9. The blood feud between Kas and Vecna stretches back centuries to a time when Kas served as Vecna's first lieutenant. More about Kas, including his stat block, appears in appendix B.

### Manipulation in Motion

After the Dark Powers released him, Kas tracked down a cell of Vecna's cultists, who told the vampire more about the lich-god's planned ritual. The vampire used the [Crown of Lies](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/crown-of-lies-veor.md) to intercept a message from Alustriel to Mordenkainen, then used the crown to mimic Mordenkainen. Kas then met with Alustriel and gained her confidence.

While posing as Mordenkainen, Kas sabotages the archmages' [Wish](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell. As a consequence, the spell shunts the characters to Alustriel's sanctum. Suspecting that the characters are somehow linked to Vecna, Kas urges them to retrieve the pieces of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md). As Mordenkainen, Kas claims that the rod is the only way to weaken Vecna to the point where the characters might thwart his ritual and banish the lich-god to Oerth.

In truth, Kas intends to steal the *Rod of Seven Parts* once he has all the pieces. He plans to whisk the artifact to the plane of Pandemonium, use it to free the demon known as Miska the Wolf-Spider, and kill Vecna. Kas doesn't yet know the site of Vecna's ritual is also on Pandemonium, the same plane where Miska is imprisoned, but the vampire finds out later in this adventure.

#### Kas in the Sanctum

While disguised as Mordenkainen, Kas never lets his guard down or removes the [Crown of Lies](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/crown-of-lies-veor.md). Occasionally during this adventure, Mordenkainen is absent from the sanctum. During these interludes, the vampire warlord travels to other realms and eventually deduces where Vecna plans to enact the multiverse-unraveling ritual. This sets into motion the betrayal that takes place in chapter 9.

#### Evidence of Deception

While in the sanctum, Kas is careful to leave no direct evidence that he's not Mordenkainen. In Mordenkainen's quarters (area S8), Kas leaves spellbooks and collections of notes spread across the desk to reinforce his fake identity.

However, a character who searches Mordenkainen's quarters and succeeds on a DC 30 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notices that none of the famed spells Mordenkainen authored are mentioned in these spellbooks or notes. The jumbled notes are written awkwardly, while Mordenkainen is known for his academic, methodical style.

Any thorough search of Mordenkainen's quarters yields a black [Bag of Holding](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bag-of-holding.md) tucked underneath the mattress. Inside the bag is a mundane silver chain bearing a sword-shaped pendant inlaid with black diamonds, worth 5,000 gp total. Also inside is a magically preserved, leather-bound journal.

The journal's contents are written in a cipher. A character who spends at least 1 hour examining the text can make a successful DC 30 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, decoding it on a success. The journal tells the story of two people called "K." and "V." who once crafted murderous battle plans together, but then parted bitterly and became enemies. A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([History](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check reveals that this story refers to Kas and Vecna.

##### Mordenkainen's Secret

If the characters find out at any point in this adventure that Mordenkainen is Kas in disguise, it counts as a secret for the purposes of the Power of Secrets rules in this book's introduction.

#### If They Find Out?

![Malaina van Talstiv](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/031-02-004-malaina-van-talstiv.webp#center)

Although it's unlikely, the characters might become suspicious of Mordenkainen and question him. The characters could investigate the wizard's activities outside the Sigil sanctum, or they might find the strange personal items in Mordenkainen's [Bag of Holding](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/bag-of-holding.md). If the characters put sufficient effort into their investigations, consider allowing them to discover before chapter 9 that Mordenkainen is an impostor.

##### Kas Defeats the Characters

If the characters confront Kas before chapter 9, allow the battle to play out using the stat block for [Kas](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/kas-the-betrayer-veor.md) in appendix B. If Kas defeats the characters, he kills them and absconds to Pandemonium. Alustriel has the clerics of Silverymoon bring the characters back to life, apologetic for not discovering Kas's ruse and angry she was duped. Alustriel suspects Kas knows where Vecna weaves his ritual and encourages the characters to follow the vampire to Pandemonium when they can.

In this case, Kas lacks the completed [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md). Adjust chapter 10 to reflect that Miska never begins to escape his prison. The characters' priority remains stopping Vecna, but if they don't permanently destroy Kas, at some point the vampire hunts down the characters. Once the characters eventually defeat Kas, they learn where Vecna weaves his ritual and can proceed to chapter 11.

##### The Characters Defeat Kas

If the characters defeat Kas, allow them to decide how to proceed. They might still want to reassemble the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) to use its power against the lich-god. However, to reinforce the story's sense of urgency, feel free to skip the characters ahead to chapter 10. If you do, award the characters the appropriate number of milestone level-ups so they have a fair chance of defeating the threats in the adventure's final chapters.

## Surprise Development

When the failed [Wish](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell transports the characters to Alustriel's sanctum, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> With a flash of multicolored light, the world winks out of existence. Nothingness envelops your senses, though you feel the thrum of magic rushing like an electric spark through your veins.
> 
> When you regain focus, you stand in a plush, candlelit parlor. A stately woman in blue robes leans toward you, her brow furrowed in confusion and concern. In the blurry background stand a frowning woman in a flowing, black dress and a man tugging in confusion at his high, crimson collar.{ #0ed}


The characters appear in area S3 of the Sigil sanctum. The woman leaning toward the characters is Alustriel, and the two individuals behind her are Tasha and Mordenkainen. "You can't be the answer to our *Wish*," Tasha sneers, while Alustriel shushes her and ushers the characters toward the sanctum's comfortable lounge furniture.

### Some Answers

At this point, Alustriel explains where the characters are and how they arrived, though she doesn't understand why they teleported to the sanctum as a result of the [Wish](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell. She then introduces herself and her wizardly companions.

![Kas](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/032-02-005-kas.webp#center)

As the characters try to figure out what's going on, Alustriel asks whether they have any ties to Vecna. If the characters mention Vecna's Link, Alustriel reasons that the characters' fate must somehow be interwoven with Vecna's. She surmises that since the *Wish* was unable to fulfill its parameters, it instead found beings tied to Vecna and brought them to Sigil. She then explains everything she knows as described in "Rise of the Lich-God" earlier in this chapter.

#### Aftermath of a Wish

As the characters interact with Alustriel, Tasha stands near them, aloof and occasionally interjecting acerbic comments. Mordenkainen remains silent, focusing intensely on everything the characters say.

After a few minutes of conversation, the characters notice that the Wizards Three seem tired and weakened. Any character proficient in the [Medicine](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Medicine) skill understands that the wizards are extremely fatigued. Any character proficient in the [Arcana](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana) skill realizes that the wizards expended a great deal of arcane energy casting the *Wish* spell. (Mordenkainen is faking his fatigue, but in the context of Alustriel and Tasha's real physical weakness, it seems legitimate.)

### A New Plan

After the characters absorb their situation, Alustriel expresses concern that the wizards can't stop Vecna. Mordenkainen says, "I have an alternative plan."

Mordenkainen strides over to a cabinet full of magic items and picks up a silver chime. He then approaches the characters, displays the chime, and says the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I worried that perhaps our *Wish* wouldn't stop one as powerful as Vecna. Alustriel, please forgive me, but I did plan a contingency.
> 
> "Vecna is too powerful to stop directly at this point. However, no power is absolute. I suspect Vecna will be vulnerable while he weaves his ritual. If you confront and weaken him, this *Chime of Exile* can banish him to Oerth. He would no longer be able to affect multiple realms at once. His plan to remake the multiverse would fail."{ #0f1}


Mordenkainen's eyes gleam with excitement as he continues:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "There is an artifact that is, I believe, the only way to weaken Vecna so the chime can be used against him. It's called the *Rod of Seven Parts*. Unfortunately, its component pieces are scattered across existence.
> 
> "While my esteemed colleagues researched the magic needed to cast a *Wish* spell powerful enough to stop Vecna, I looked into finding the rod's pieces should we need them. The first piece is deep in the Underdark, somewhere inside a hidden safe house for worshipers of the demon-god Lolth. Web's Edge, it's called.
> 
> "Find that first piece of the rod, my friends. The portal on the dais will take you to it. Once you locate the first piece, the magic inherent in the artifact will point you to the second piece, and then to the third, and so on. This sanctum's portal reacts to powerful magic such as this artifact, so as you find each piece, this portal will lead to the next. No need to use another key; the most recent piece of the rod will suffice.
> 
> "There's no time to waste. Once you've reassembled the rod, we can all confront Vecna and stop his heinous plan. You'll be the heroes of the multiverse! How does that sound?"{ #0f2}


![Subtle evidence of Mordenk...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/033-02-006-evidence.webp#center "Subtle evidence of Mordenkainen's true identity is hidden in the sanctum")

Although taken aback at how much work Mordenkainen has done on this contingency, Alustriel and Tasha admit that the plan Mordenkainen has laid out is the best hope to stop Vecna. Alustriel compliments Mordenkainen on his foresight.

The wizards answer the characters' questions to the best of their ability. Like Mordenkainen, Alustriel and Tasha urge the characters to make haste, though they help the characters prepare for their journey any way they can. Mordenkainen, Alustriel, and Tasha explain that while the characters reassemble the rod, the archmages must continue to research Vecna's plans and potential weaknesses.

Before the characters depart for Web's Edge, Alustriel relays any information they haven't yet learned, including the details found in "Magic in the Sanctum" earlier in this chapter.

#### A Significant Lie

In the guise of Mordenkainen, Kas has lied to the characters about the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md). While the rod is useful against Vecna, Kas simply wants the characters to retrieve the rod so he can use it to free Miska.

Kas doesn't know that Vecna is weakened to pre-god status while weaving the Ritual of Remaking. The characters will learn this when they confront Vecna in chapter 11.

### Sending Vecna Back

The [Chime of Exile](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/chime-of-exile-veor.md) is Alustriel's property and ultimately can send Vecna back to Oerth, interrupting his ritual. The interruption would dissipate the secret-based magic Vecna is weaving, significantly setting back his plot and leaving the lich-god in a weakened state. If the characters wish to take the chime with them, Alustriel assents.

#### Chime of Exile

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

This silver chime is engraved with delicate magic sigils. While holding the chime, you can use an action to cast the [Banishment](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/banishment.md) spell (spell save DC 20). If the target of the spell has 50 hit points or fewer, it automatically fails its saving throw. Once the chime has been used to cast the spell, it can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

## Toward Web's Edge

![Alustriel's Chime of Exile...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/034-02-007-mordenkainen-holding-chime-of-exile.webp#center "Alustriel's Chime of Exile might help the characters defeat Vecna")

After stepping through the portal, the characters emerge deep in the Underdark in Faerûn. The rod piece is hidden in Web's Edge, a nearby safe house for agents of the demon-god Lolth.

The characters initially emerge through a door-shaped fissure in one wall of a claustrophobic, seemingly abandoned corridor outside the hidden entrance to Web's Edge. There is no light source, and the invisible portal back to Sigil remains open.

### Web's Edge Entrance

The entrance to Web's Edge is hidden mere steps from where the characters arrive in the Underdark. The 10-foot-wide doorway is closed and cloaked with a permanent invisibility effect. Those who can perceive invisible objects see a nondescript iron door. The door is sealed with an [Arcane Lock](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/arcane-lock.md) spell and requires a successful DC 22 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check using thieves' tools to open.

Visible to characters who can see invisible objects are eight symbols subtly carved into the rock above the doorway. Tiny Undercommon characters are embedded in each symbol. When touched in the order that spells out "Web's Edge," the doorway opens.

## Web's Edge

![Chime of Exile](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/035-02-008-chime-of-exile.webp#center)

Web's Edge is a hidden meeting place for agents of Lolth who operate throughout the Underdark beneath the Sword Coast, pursuing missions for the glory of their demon-god. These agents use Web's Edge to plot infiltration missions targeting virtuous clerical orders; to sabotage efforts to quash Lolth's worship; to orchestrate the upheaval of good-aligned governments; and to plan large-scale conversion efforts in Underdark cities, including Blingdenstone, Gracklstugh, and Mithral Hall.

Agents might spend a few hours in Web's Edge, attending tactical meetings before dispersing. Others stay for 14 days or more while they await the arrival of colleagues from all reaches of the Underdark. A few spend months at a time in Web's Edge, using its barrack to lie low while authorities elsewhere hunt for them.

Owing to the highly sensitive and wicked work that takes place here, Web's Edge is a carefully guarded secret. Only the highest-ranking covert operatives and members of Lolth's clergy know about it, though powerful demons and devils allied with the Spider Queen are also aware of Web's Edge. A few cultists live in Web's Edge to maintain its facilities and serve as support staff to the operatives. These cultists are confined to the facility for life—a sacrifice they make willingly to show their devotion to the Spider Queen.

### General Features

Recurring features of Web's Edge are described in the following sections.

#### Agents and Cultists

No matter why they're in Web's Edge, all Lolth worshipers here are fanatics devoted to the demon-god. In a battle against the characters, these fanatics always fight to the death.

#### Ceilings

The ceilings in most areas of Web's Edge are 20 feet high, with stalactites occasionally jutting down a few feet. The ceilings in the fodder chamber (area W9) and Sacred Web Hall (area W12) are 50 feet tall and relatively smooth.

#### Doors

The doors in Web's Edge are made of iron. The doors to areas W3, W4, and W5 are sealed with [Arcane Lock](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/arcane-lock.md) spells, requiring a successful DC 20 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check using thieves' tools to unlock. Additionally, areas W6a–W6d are locked and each require a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check using thieves' tools to unlock. The [nalfeshnee](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/nalfeshnee.md) in area W5 carries keys to all the cells in area W6. All other doors in Web's Edge are unlocked.

#### Lighting

There are no natural or magical light sources in the complex. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or some other means of seeing in the dark. Light sources bring the attention of the complex's denizens, although the characters might not immediately be recognized as intruders (see "Infiltrating Web's Edge" below).

#### Safe from Prying Eyes

Everyone in Web's Edge is under the effect of a [Nondetection](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/nondetection.md) spell while inside the structure.

#### Walls

The walls in Web's Edge are rocky, jagged, and uneven. Decades ago, Lolth's faithful enlarged the chamber that contains Sacred Web Hall (area W12) using the [Stone Shape](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/stone-shape.md) spell. As such, the walls in area W12 are smooth.

### Infiltrating Web's Edge

![Heroes who stumble into We...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/036-02-009-webs-edge.webp#center "Heroes who stumble into Web's Edge unaware of its dangers usually meet a gruesome end")

Web's Edge is a dangerous place. If the characters burst into the complex without a plan, they're unlikely to survive the experience, let alone retrieve the first piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md). See the advice below for handling strategies the characters might adopt.

#### Being Sneaky

If the characters are careful, they might be able to sneak through Web's Edge and steal the rod piece without anyone catching them.

If any devotees in Web's Edge spot the characters infiltrating the safe house, they scream for help to any denizen within earshot and attack unless otherwise noted.

#### Impersonating Worshipers

Masquerading as devotees of Lolth could be an effective strategy. Creatures of all backgrounds and origins use Web's Edge as a meeting place, a safe house, and a place of worship. Web's Edge has only a handful of permanent attendants, none of whom could possibly be familiar with every Lolth agent in the Underdark.

If the characters want to blend in with the Lolth worshipers, any disguises they use (magical or otherwise) should include spider-shaped paraphernalia. A successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Religion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) or Intelligence ([History](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check reveals that "The Spider Queen smiles on you" is a typical religious greeting that those in Web's Edge expect to hear from fellow devotees. Any creature in Web's Edge who sees a character wearing something spider-shaped or hears the character speak this greeting has disadvantage on ability checks to see through the characters' disguises.

Devotees in Web's Edge who identify the characters as impostors scream for help and attack.

### Web's Edge Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 2.2.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 2.2: Web's Edge](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/037-2-02-webs-edge.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/038-2-02-webs-edge-player.webp#gallery)

#### W1: False Front

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The remains of mold-covered broken wagons and barrels languish in this large foyer. Humanoid skeletal remains lie strewn about, their swords and armor bent and rusted. Something gleams next to the bodies propped along the northern wall. Double doors on the east, northeast, and southeast walls are rusted shut, and a semicircular chamber that opens in the southwest wall contains a shrine.{ #105}


To convince unwelcome visitors that this cave is unused, the facility's cultists created a false front in this foyer. The skeletal remains and rusted gear belong to five long-dead adventurers whom the characters can identify as two dwarves, an elf, a gnome, and a tiefling.

##### Traps

The gleams in the northern part of the chamber are magical traps placed on fist-size, fake rubies tucked conspicuously next to two skeletons. The fake rubies are fixed to the floor and can't be removed. Any character who touches one of the rubies must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (`12d8`) lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The traps can't be disabled, but a character who comes within 5 feet of one of the rubies and examines it can make a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. On a success, the character deduces that the ruby is fake, worthless, and magically trapped to release a violent electric shock.

#### W2: Lolth Shrine

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This semicircular chamber forms a natural alcove. Shelves carved into the wall from floor to ceiling hold small, repulsive items, including bloody baubles, shriveled fingers, and idols carved from bone. Two figures crouch before the shelves.{ #108}


Two agents of Lolth have come to pray at this shrine. They are Makubli Khee, a chaotic evil, hobgoblin [assassin](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md), and Torkner Ironteeth, a chaotic evil, duergar [mage](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md). Because they're engrossed in their prayers, Makubli and Torkner don't notice the characters unless a member of the party deliberately hails them or the characters have a light source.

The items on the shelves are nonmagical. Any character who looks at the ceiling and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check spots a small, spider-shaped carving in the rock—a hint of this shrine's purpose.

##### Makubli and Torkner

Both Makubli and Torkner operate along the well-traveled route between Menzoberranzan and Blingdenstone, sabotaging supply caravans and generally causing mayhem. They usually kill or convert victims who survive their initial attacks, although Makubli recently turned over custody of a cyclops to the Web's Edge prison (see area W6a). Makubli and Torkner dislike each other intensely. Neither knows many other covert Lolth operatives, so clever characters could masquerade as allies (see "Impersonating Worshipers" earlier in this chapter).

The cultists who maintain Web's Edge are friendly with both agents, making Makubli and Torkner good candidates for the characters to impersonate. If either agent suspects that the characters aren't fellow Lolth operatives, they attack.

> [!gallery]
> ![Makubli Khee](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/039-02-015-makubli-khee.webp#gallery)
> ![Torkner Ironteeth](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/040-02-016-torkner-ironteeth.webp#gallery)

#### W3: Summoning Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An enormous pentagram drawn in chalk, with stubby unlit candles placed at each of its five points, covers the floor of this open chamber. A hooded figure hunches over a cluttered table in the southwest corner, mumbling profane phrases.{ #10b}


Cultists and agents gather here to commune with Lolth's Abyssal servants and occasionally summon Fiends to assist with missions. The figure at the table is Grottenelle Stonecutter, a chaotic evil, svirfneblin [mage](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) who serves as the facility's high summoner.

##### Summoning in Progress

Grottenelle is in the middle of a summoning ritual. Have Grottenelle and the characters roll initiative. If the characters attack or otherwise interrupt Grottenelle before the start of her first turn, the summoning fails. Otherwise, a [glabrezu](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/glabrezu.md) appears in the center of the pentagram at the start of Grottenelle's turn. Grottenelle attacks intruders and commands the glabrezu to do the same if the summoning is successful.

![High Summoner Grottenelle ...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/041-02-010-glabrezu.webp#center "High Summoner Grottenelle Stonecutter calls on a glabrezu to help with an evil mission the Lolth cultists are planning")

Grottenelle needs the glabrezu to assist in the operation being planned in area W7. At your discretion, the noise from a battle might alert the agents in that area, prompting them to investigate.

##### Treasure

Grottenelle's table holds a [Spell Scroll](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll.md) of [Circle of Death](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/circle-of-death.md), an ornate [+2 Dagger](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/2-weapon.md), and an assortment of unguents and oils worth 500 gp.

#### W4: Corridor

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This corridor is empty. Heavy iron double doors bookend the western and eastern access points.{ #10f}


Additionally, if the characters haven't yet explored area W3, read the following aloud:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> From the north, you hear a faint voice mumbling profane phrases.{ #110}


The cultists keep the door to the fodder chamber (area W9) closed in case the food intended for Ker-arach in the Sacred Web Hall (area W12) tries to escape.

#### W5: Guardian Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An enormous, winged biped with a boar's head paces in front of a barred prison door to the southwest. A ring of keys hangs from a hook on the creature's trident.{ #112}


The creature is a [nalfeshnee](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/nalfeshnee.md) named Maaltok, the guardian and keeper of the prison cells (areas W6a–W6d). Sometime in the last few decades, Maaltok switched allegiance from Graz'zt to Lolth. Since he is a recent recruit, Maaltok's yochlol handlers assigned him guard duty, which he performs grudgingly.

Maaltok knows each of the prison cells' inhabitants and doesn't expect infiltrators. If the characters are impersonating devotees of Lolth, Maaltok tells them who's imprisoned in each cell.

##### Cell Keys

Maaltok carries keys to each of the cells in the prison (areas W6a–W6d). Stealing Maaltok's key ring without his knowledge requires a successful DC 16 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check.

#### W6: Holding Cells

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Four jail cells are arrayed along the south wall of this cavern. The first holds a cyclops; the second holds a dead elf; the third holds a bugbear slumped against a bench; and the fourth holds a hunched, gray-skinned figure in robes. A worn chest sits along the room's northwest wall. Leaning next to it is a giant-size club.{ #115}


The chest contains confiscated weapons and equipment from prisoners kept in the nearby cells. It's locked and requires a DC 20 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check using thieves' tools to open.

##### Treasure

Inside the chest are a [+1 Dagger](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-weapon.md) and a [+1 Longsword](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/1-weapon.md) confiscated from the recently deceased elf prisoner, Fernil, whose body is in area W6b. The giant-size club next to the chest is a [+2 Greatclub](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/2-weapon.md) that belongs to Gertrude, the cyclops imprisoned in area W6a. The greatclub resizes to serve its wielder.

#### W6a: Holding Cell A

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A burly cyclops sits on a bench in this jail cell, shackled to the walls by her hands and legs. She holds her head in her hands, looking defeated.{ #118}


This jail cell contains a bench and a bucket. The inhabitant is Gertrude, a chaotic neutral [cyclops](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md) who was the lone survivor of an attack on a supply caravan near the ruins of the city of Ched Nasad. Makubli (see area W2) captured Gertrude weeks ago and brought her here as a prisoner, hoping she would reveal information about Blingdenstone's interest in Ched Nasad. Gertrude is a caravan guard and has no information the cultists can use; as soon as they realize this, they'll kill Gertrude, and she knows it. Her prized [+2 Greatclub](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/2-weapon.md) is stashed in the chest in area W6.

##### Recruiting Gertrude

Gertrude hates Lolth and is eager to escape Web's Edge. If she realizes the characters are infiltrators, she begs them to free her. In exchange for her freedom, Gertrude offers to help the characters, including giving them her greatclub from the chest in area W6.

##### Gertrude's Secret

Even if the characters free her, Gertrude remains despondent. If the characters ask her what's wrong, Gertrude reveals that her friend, a svirfneblin named Rockzanna, was involved in a nearby mining operation and discovered that two of the operation's leaders were secret Lolth cultists planning an attack on the operation. Rockzanna was too scared to tell anyone besides Gertrude, and the cyclops fears a terrible fate for the miners.

Regardless of the characters' reaction to this revelation, learning it counts for the purposes of the Power of Secrets rules in this book's introduction. The mining operation is the same one the cultists in area W7 are discussing.

#### W6b: Holding Cell B

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This jail cell contains a bench and a tattered blanket. The desiccated corpse of an elf lies on the floor.{ #11c}


The body was once an elf named Fernil Orellian, an adventurer and priest of Corellon Larethian. A cloaker in the Underdark injured Fernil and killed his companions. An agent of Lolth came upon Fernil and marched him to Web's Edge, where he died shortly thereafter.

##### Treasure

Any character who examines the body and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notices a vial tucked into the corpse's belt. This is a [Potion of Fire Resistance](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-fire-resistance.md)—the agent of Lolth never noticed it.

#### W6c: Holding Cell C

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A bugbear with thick eyebrows is slumped on the bench against the wall in this jail cell.{ #11f}


Although she looks like she's sleeping, the bugbear in this cell, Rothgral, is dead. She deserted a band of mercenaries based near Mithral Hall after meeting a persuasive duergar agent of Lolth named Vundren. Vundren brought Rothgral here, but the cultists determined the bugbear didn't have the skills necessary to become a covert Lolth operative. The cultists imprisoned her until they could determine what to do with her, and she died about a day ago due to neglect.

#### W6d: Holding Cell D

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A gray-skinned creature with stringy, black hair and cultist's robes sits hunched in a corner of this cell.{ #121}


This prisoner is Sril Brayspoke, a chaotic evil [grimlock](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/grimlock.md). Until a week ago, Sril was a cultist in residence at Web's Edge devoted to serving the Spider Queen. However, the bumbling Sril accidentally insulted the yochlol in area W12. The powerful Fiend had Sril thrown into jail, and the cultists are considering feeding him to Ker-arach to appease Lolth.

##### Recruiting Sril

Whether the characters are masquerading as Lolth worshipers or not, Sril begs to join the characters. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check knows that Sril is still devoted to Lolth and will betray the characters if necessary to return to the cultists' good graces. If Sril is freed and knows the characters are impostors, he reveals their charade as soon as he sees another Lolth devotee.

#### W7: Meeting Room

![The Lolth cultists are pla...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/042-02-011-lolth-cultist.webp#center "The Lolth cultists are planning an assault on a nearby svirfneblin mining operation")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Relief carvings of spiders in webs decorate this chamber's walls, which are papered over with tactical maps and schematics. Gathered around a paperwork-covered table in the room's center are several cloaked figures as well as a horned, winged devil with a whip on her belt.{ #124}


![Jolera Hartoph](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/043-02-014-jolera.webp#center)

Seven Lolth devotees are meeting in this room to plan an assault on a svirfneblin mining operation located about 20 miles from Web's Edge. The devotees have coordinated with two Lolth operatives embedded in the mining operation. The devotees plan to kidnap the most powerful miners and feed them to Ker-arach in area W12. They'll kill any remaining miners who don't worship Lolth.

The devotees include a chaotic evil, elf [assassin](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) named Jolera Hartoph; two [mages](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) named Bromtok and Shiroktu, who are chaotic evil orcs; two [grimlocks](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/grimlock.md) named Roltharni and Sharlotte, who are chaotic evil; and an [erinyes](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) named Fernitha.

Fernitha, Bromtok, and Shiroktu plan to attack the svirfneblin while the deep gnomes rest. If the characters eavesdrop on the planning before they investigate the summoning chamber (area W3), they learn that the high summoner, Grottenelle Stonecutter, is summoning a glabrezu to help with the operation.

The Lolth devotees here attack any apparent interlopers. The [glabrezu](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/glabrezu.md) summoned in area W3 joins the fight if the characters haven't already defeated the demon (or prevented its summoning).

#### W8: Mission Hall

The east end of this hallway holds a secret door that leads into the Sacred Web Hall (area W12). A character who examines the wall and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds the door, which serves as an escape for the cultists who attend to Ker-arach when the creature is in a particularly foul mood.

#### W9: Fodder Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Peering from this rocky room's center are four large lizards. The pungent smell of raw meat hangs in the air.{ #127}


The cultists keep a supply of prey creatures here to feed Ker-arach. Right now, the chamber is occupied by four [giant lizards](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-lizard.md). The cultists release a lizard into the Sacred Web Hall (area W12) whenever Ker-arach is grumpy, providing her with recreation and a meal.

##### Releasing the Lizards

The cultists recently fed the lizards raw meat from the pantry in area W10, so the creatures are complacent. A character who holds raw meat near a giant lizard can successfully give that lizard simple commands (such as "follow me," "go where I point," or "bite her") for 10 minutes without giving the lizard the meat. If the lizard doesn't get the meat after 10 minutes, it attacks that character.

If either exit is left open, the lizards meander into the complex. If a lizard wanders into area W12, Ker-arach has disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks and initiative rolls made in relation to the characters, since she is distracted while trying to capture the lizard and cocoon it in the chamber's central web.

#### W10: Barrack of the Faithful

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Five bedrolls, each with a small chest beside it, are tucked into this room. A large desk stands near the east wall. A small room to the south holds a long table with chairs around it.{ #12a}


This meager barrack houses the cultists who live in Web's Edge.

##### Chests

The chests contain the personal belongings of each cultist. Each chest is locked and requires a successful DC 18 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check using thieves' tools to open.

Each chest contains a ceremonial holy symbol of Lolth worth 50 gp. The chest near the bedroll closest to the entrance also contains two [Potions of Healing (superior)](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-superior-healing.md). The chest near the southernmost bedroll contains a [Gem of Seeing](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/gem-of-seeing.md).

##### Desk

A [Detect Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the desk, which bears a magical trap. Any character who touches the desk releases a swarm of spiders and must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 20 (`8d4`) poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The trap triggers once, after which the spiders disappear and the desk becomes nonmagical. Casting [Dispel Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) on the desk removes the trap.

The desk contains notes about covert missions the Lolth worshipers are planning in the next few months. Additionally, it contains gold- and gem-encrusted, spider-shaped knickknacks worth 500 gp total.

##### Dining Area

The resident cultists eat and store their food in the room to the south. Characters who search the room find boxes of dried meat and other shelf-stable provisions. An ice box in the southeast corner is full of raw meat, which the characters can use to command the giant lizards in area W9.

#### W11: Passageway

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> At the east end of this hallway is an enormous pile of bones.{ #12f}


The bones are remnants of meals eaten by Ker-arach, the spiderdragon in area W12.

#### W12: Sacred Web Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An enormous web stretches across this open cavern's center, its strands plastered over stalagmites and stalactites. Crawling on the web is a gigantic reptilian creature with eight legs. Near that creature stands a smaller, one-eyed creature with a body that resembles melting wax.{ #131}


This cavern's ceilings are 50 feet tall. The cavern is the lair of Ker-arach, the [spiderdragon](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/spiderdragon-veor.md) (see appendix A). Ker-arach crawled into this cavern through a temporary rift to the Abyss that opened during a ritual conducted here about half a year ago. Ker-arach brought with her a piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md), which she uses to answer questions posed directly to the Spider Queen. Ker-arach is essentially a tourist attraction for the few Lolth devotees who know she exists. The cultists consider her a sign of Lolth's favor, even though she eats hundreds of pounds of meat every few days and doesn't otherwise contribute to the complex.

![A piece of the Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/044-02-012-first-rod-of-seven-parts-piece.webp#center)

Standing near Ker-arach is a [yochlol](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/yochlol.md) named Ylellith, which the cultists recently summoned to help with a mission. When the creatures see the characters and realize the characters are enemies, they attack and fight to the death.

##### Ker-arach's Web

The web in the center of the cavern is made of ultra-strong, ultra-sticky strands of Ker-arach's silk. Additionally, Ker-arach has spun other, smaller webs throughout the area. The webs are "difficult terrain". Any creature that enters the webbing for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or it becomes stuck and has the [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition. As an action, a creature can try to pull itself or another creature within its reach from the webbing, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A creature freed in this way is no longer restrained by the webbing.

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away, dealing 5 (`2d4`) fire damage to any creature in that area.

##### Retrieving the Rod Piece

The [first piece](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) is wrapped tightly in silk at the center of this cavern's web. Characters who have [darkvision](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) or a light source can see the rod piece from up to 30 feet away. A character within reach of the rod piece can use a sharp tool to cut it free of the web as an action. For more about the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md), see this book's introduction.

## Next Steps

![The spiderdragon Ker-arach...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/045-02-013-ker-arach.webp#center "The spiderdragon Ker-arach and the yochlol Ylellith use a piece of the Rod of Seven Parts to communicate directly with the demon-god Lolth")

Once the characters have acquired the first piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md), they can return to Sigil through the portal that remains open outside Web's Edge. At this point, the characters will likely want to rest, confer with their allies in Sigil, and see where this first rod piece points them to go next.

When the characters return to the sanctum, Malaina is there (see "The Sigil Sanctum" earlier in this chapter for more details). Malaina offers to help however she can, including seeking information outside of Sigil or retrieving specific magic items the characters might want.

Once the characters have concluded their business in the sanctum, they can begin their quest for the location of the second rod piece, as described in the next chapter.
