# Chapter 8: The Dragon Queen's Pride
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin* 

![The heroes' quest for the ...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/121-08-001-red-belvedere.webp#center "The heroes' quest for the final rod piece takes them into a casino in the heart of Avernus")

The adventurers discover that the final piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) is in the heart of Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. The characters must infiltrate a diabolical casino dedicated to Tiamat, Queen of Evil Dragons, whose lair is nearby.

## Running This Chapter

This chapter begins after the characters retrieve the sixth piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md). A character who holds this piece knows instinctively that the seventh piece is located somewhere inside a casino called the Red Belvedere in Avernus. The Wizards Three warn the characters that finding this location might be difficult since the Nine Hells are impossible to map and difficult to traverse.

Once the characters enter Avernus, they must hitch a ride on an infernal war machine and traverse the hellish landscape to reach the Red Belvedere. The characters must manipulate the Fiends in the casino's highest ranks to enter the exclusive Ruby Sanctum, then fight Tiamat's championâ€”or convince Tiamat to give up the final rod piece.

### Character Advancement

The characters should be 17th level when this chapter begins. They gain a level once they retrieve the seventh and final piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) from the casino's Ruby Sanctum.

### Power of Secrets

The individuals the characters meet in Avernus are primarily Fiends and other unpleasant beings. As a rule, these creatures lack the remorse, guilt, and shame that would give their secrets power if revealed to the characters. The characters don't learn any secrets applicable to the rules in "The Power of Secrets" section found in this book's introduction, though they can spend secrets during this chapter normally.

### Seventh Rod Piece

The final piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) is in area N5 in the Ruby Sanctum, located in the Dragon's Pride area of the Red Belvedere casino. For more information about the rod and the spell this rod piece allows its wielder to cast, see this book's introduction.

## Avernus

This chapter takes place in Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells of Baator.

### Knowledge of Avernus

Characters who research Avernus in Sigil can learn the following:

- **Blood War.** Avernus is a major battlefield for the Blood War, the raging conflict between demons and devils. It would be fruitless to fight every Fiend the characters come across in Avernus, since conflicts invariably escalate as infernal combatants join in against interlopers in the Nine Hells. To accomplish their goals, the characters might need to work with Fiends.  
- **Environment.** Avernus is a hellscape in the most literal sense: a ravaged battlefield littered with decaying carcasses and wrecked war machines. A foul haze perpetually shrouds the skies. Ambient light swells above the horizon in a grim mockery of a sunset, but the sky is bereft of celestial bodies. Searing gusts of wind blast across the landscape, reeking of ash and brimstone. Due to this perpetual smoky twilight, there are no real days or nights in Avernus. Time passes as usual, though, and can be tracked in hour increments.  
- **History.** Long ago, Avernus was a tantalizing paradise created by the archdevil Asmodeus to tempt mortals. However, the incursion of the River Styx and hordes of demons ruined that paradise, leaving behind gore and destruction.  
- **Queen of Dragons.** Tiamat is the five-headed progenitor of the chromatic dragons in some realms and embodies the vices of evil dragonkind. Her lair is located in Avernus, connected to numerous monuments and temples scattered across the hellscape.  

### Spell Modifications

Drenched in the eldritch energy of the Nine Hells, Avernus warps magic used within its borders. At your discretion, a spell can be cosmetically modified to demonstrate the corruption of Avernus; these modifications don't change the spell's mechanical effects. The following are some examples:

[Hunter's Mark](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hunters-mark.md). A spectral crown of spiked iron encircles the target's head.

[Mage Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md). The conjured hand takes the shape of a taloned claw.

[Magic Missile](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-missile.md). The missiles emit a haunting wail when fired.

### Traversing Avernus

Avernus warps the senses, making distance impossible to gauge. The Wizards Three can't be sure where the characters will emerge in Avernus from the portal in Sigil, so they'll have to find their way to their destination. Residents of Avernus use vehicles known as infernal war machines to make trips more manageable. The Wizards Three suggest that the characters might be able to reach the Red Belvedere by using or commandeering one of these vehicles.

## Descending into Avernus

When the characters step through the portal in Sigil, they emerge along a shelf in a mountainside cliff. Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Shrieking gusts of hot air assault your senses as you step into Avernus. Miasmic clouds roil over a ravaged landscape of broken rocks, bleached bones, and jagged metal. The dusty atmosphere reeks of sulfur and tar.{ #3f9}


The characters know they need to travel to the Red Belvedere, but they don't know where the casino is located. The warped nature of the Nine Hells defies all mapping attempts, so the characters must figure out how to get to their destination.

If consulted, the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) points away from the mountains and down the cliff, where a rough path skirts the cliff's base.

### Hell of a Ride

![The erinyes roam the blast...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/122-08-001-venatrix.webp#center "The erinyes roam the blasted landscape in a vehicle called the Venatrix")

The characters can descend the cliff without trouble. Once they do, they catch the attention of a crew of scavengers. Read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Out of the red dust clouds barrels an angular metal vehicle, ten feet tall, with spiked tires and hellfire roaring in its engine. Tortured screams issue from its furnace. The vehicle slows to a halt, and a winged silhouette jumps out and waves at you.{ #3fb}


The infernal war machine [Venatrix](3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/venatrix-veor.md) has room for four Medium or smaller creatures to ride inside the vehicle, including its driver, and for four Medium or smaller creatures to ride in its upper, open-air area. Three [erinyes](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) crew the [Venatrix](3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/venatrix-veor.md): Nykaia, who leaps out to greet the characters, and Kypris and Mykale, who are inside.

Nykaia is the group's glib and calculating leader, Kypris is their unflappable engineer and driver, and Mykale is their overeager weapons specialist. The three devils travel the wasteland of Avernus harvesting scrap metal and other valuable materials. The group is searching for additional crew members to aid them in their latest score.

Seeing that the characters lack a vehicle, Nykaia offers them a deal: if the characters help her with a job, she and her crew will give them a ride to wherever they'd like. If the characters refuse, skip to the "Stop for Directions" section.

The three erinyes are hoping to take down a [goristro](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/goristro.md): a minotaur-like demon that carries demonic legions and rare treasures through the battlefields of the Blood War. They need someone to focus on the goristro while they take out the soldiers on its back.

Nykaia knows about the Red Belvedere but refuses to provide any more information until the characters help with the goristro. If the characters agree to her deal, she welcomes them aboard the [Venatrix](3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/venatrix-veor.md). Nykaia isn't hostile toward the characters and won't attack them unless the characters threaten her or start a fight.

If the characters attack Nykaia or attempt to take the [Venatrix](3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/venatrix-veor.md) by force, Kypris and Mykale emerge from the war machine and join the fight. If the erinyes are in danger of losing the fight, they surrender and beg the characters to spare them, offering to drive the characters to the Red Belvedere in exchange.

#### Driving the Venatrix

The following rules are an adjusted, condensed version of the infernal war machine rules found in Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus.

##### Driving

The helm of an infernal war machine is a chair with a wheel, levers, pedals, and other controls. The helm requires a driver to operate.

While the [Venatrix](3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/venatrix-veor.md)'s engine is on, the driver can use an action to propel the vehicle up to its speed (see the "Vehicle Statistics" section below) or bring the vehicle to a dead stop. While the vehicle is moving, the driver can steer it along any course.

If the driver has the [incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition, leaves the helm, or does nothing to alter the [Venatrix](3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/venatrix-veor.md)'s course and speed, the vehicle moves in the same direction and at the same speed it did during the driver's last turn until it hits an obstacle big enough to stop it.

As a bonus action, the driver can do one of the following:

- Start the [Venatrix](3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/venatrix-veor.md)'s engine or shut it off.  
- Cause the [Venatrix](3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/venatrix-veor.md) to take the [Dash](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash) or [Disengage](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Disengage) action while the vehicle's engine is running  
- Insert a Soul Coin into the engine's furnace  

##### Soul Fuel

The Venatrix's engine has a furnace fueled by Soul Coins (described later in this chapter). Among the vehicle's helm controls is a narrow slot into which Soul Coins can be fed. The vehicle's furnace consumes a Soul Coin instantly, expending all the coin's remaining charges at once and destroying the coin in the process. The soul trapped in the coin becomes trapped in the furnace instead, giving the vehicle 24 hours of fuel for each charge the Soul Coin had when it was consumed (maximum 72 hours). The furnace can hold any number of souls, their screams of anguish audible out to a range of 60 feet.

The [Venatrix](3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/venatrix-veor.md) currently has enough soul fuel to run for 60 hours.

##### Vehicle Statistics

The Venatrix is a Gargantuan vehicle that can hold eight Medium creatures and carry up to 1 ton of cargo. It has a speed of 100 feet; AC 19; a damage threshold of 10; 200 hit points; immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage; and a +4 bonus to Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

##### Weapon Stations

The Venatrix is equipped with two harpoon guns and an infernal screamer, which is a writhing humanoid torso made of melting wax with a barbed hand crank between its shoulder blades. The weapons are mounted to the vehicle's exterior, so any creature riding on the outside of the vehicle can operate a weapon. Each weapon station requires one creature to operate it.

A creature operating a harpoon gun can use an action to make a ranged weapon attack with it (+6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target). On a hit, the harpoon deals 10 (`2d8 + 1`) piercing damage.

A creature operating the infernal screamer can use an action to turn its crank, unleashing a telepathic shriek of agony at one target the creature can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 26 (`4d12`) psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Goristro Raid

This encounter occurs only if the characters teamed up with the [erinyes](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) in the previous encounter. If the characters instead defeated the erinyes and claimed the [Venatrix](3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/venatrix-veor.md) for themselves or bypassed the erinyes entirely, skip to the "Stop for Directions" section.

It takes about an hour for the [Venatrix](3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/venatrix-veor.md) to travel to the goristro's location. As the [Venatrix](3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/venatrix-veor.md) approaches the goristro, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Thunderous footsteps shake the ground as you approach a horned, red-furred demon over twenty feet tall. Two winged shapes flank its towering form. On its back is a tented palanquin occupied by demonic soldiers swarming like insects.{ #402}


The hulking [goristro](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/goristro.md) is flanked by two [vrocks](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/vrock.md). Inside the goristro's palanquin are two [hezrous](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/hezrou.md) and five [quasits](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md), as well as the "treasure" that the [erinyes](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) are after: a [unicorn](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/unicorn.md) named Sterling in an iron cage.

Nykaia explains that Kypris will drive the war machine close to the goristro. The three erinyes will then fly to the palanquin to defeat the demons within while the characters slay the goristro.

The goristro defends itself. If the vrocks see that the goristro is losing, they join the fight. The three erinyes easily dispatch the demons in the palanquin.

#### True Treasure Revealed

Once combat finishes, the three erinyes carry down their claimed treasure:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large cage lands with a thud before the vehicle. Through the iron bars, you see the white fur and gilded mane of a unicorn as it nickers in fear.{ #405}


Mykale excitedly explains that a unicorn's horn is a highly valuable ritual ingredient that will ingratiate the erinyes with powerful infernal war leaders. The unicorn desperately wishes to be freed and says as much in Celestial and Elvish.

Characters who try to convince the erinyes to release the unicorn must make a DC 30 Charisma ([Persuasion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If the characters offer a rare or rarer magic item in exchange for Sterling's freedom, this check is made with advantage. On a successful check, the erinyes give the characters custody of Sterling. If the characters attempt to take Sterling by force, the erinyes become hostile and attack.

With Sterling (or a traded magic item) now in their possession, the three erinyes uphold their end of the deal and take the characters to the Red Belvedere. If the characters slay two of the erinyes, the third erinyes surrenders and offers to drive the characters to the Red Belvedere in exchange for her life.

### Stop for Directions

If the characters are forced to search the plains and battlefields of Avernus for the Red Belvedere because they have no one to lead them there, have the party's navigator make a DC 20 Wisdom ([Survival](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check at the end of every hour of travel. After each successful check, the characters find something to steer them in the right direction; determine the source of this help by rolling on the Stop for Directions table. After four successful checks, the characters locate the Red Belvedere.

**Stop for Directions**

`dice: [](09-chapter-8-the-dragon-queens-pride.md#^stop-for-directions)`

| dice: d6 | Source of Help |
|----------|----------------|
| 1â€“3 | An iron signpost in the middle of nowhere points in the direction of the Red Belvedere. |
| 4 | A friendly [imp](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) knows the way to the Red Belvedere. After tagging along for an hour and giving directions, the imp turns [invisible](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) and leaves. |
| 5 | A [ghost](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) doomed to wander the battlefields of Avernus points the way to the Red Belvedere. |
| 6 | An indifferent [bearded devil](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md) hitchhiker offers directions, preferably in exchange for food, drink, or a free ride. |{ #stop-for-directions}


## The Red Belvedere

Eventually, the characters reach the Red Belvedere. The casino is a remnant of Avernus's original existence: a bucolic paradise designed to tempt mortal souls. Its edifice was destroyed in the carnage of the Blood War, but a champion of Tiamat named [Windfall](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/windfall-veor.md) rebuilt the casino and rededicated it to the Dragon Queen as a celebration of her god's greed and vanity.

The Red Belvedere is more than a monument to the Dragon Queen. The casino is connected via a tunnel to Tiamat's lair, and Tiamat can hear every prayer and proclamation of her power uttered within the buildings' walls.

As the characters approach the Red Belvedere, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Jagged mountains give way to an unexpectedly beautiful sight: a sprawling, palatial complex glittering with silver and gold. Light dances through the front rotunda's red stained-glass dome, reflecting off the overcast sky to shower the buildings with a rosy glow. A carved stone sign at the front of the complex reads in numerous languages, "The Red Belvedere."{ #408}


If the crew of the [Venatrix](3-Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/venatrix-veor.md) is with the party, the erinyes bid the characters goodbye at the front of the casino.

### Casino Lobby

The Red Belvedere's layout is shown on map 8.1.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 8.1: The Red Belvedere](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/123-map-8-01-the-red-belvedere.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/124-map-8-01-the-red-belvedere-player.webp#gallery)

When the characters first enter the casino's rotunda lobby, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Sweet perfume and glittering lights chase away all evidence of the war-torn landscape outside. A gilded statue of a roaring dragon presides over the casino's lobby. Distantly, you hear clattering coins and patrons laughing in preternaturally deep voices.
> 
> A winged tiefling soars above the spectacle. Patches of multicolored scales freckle her skin, and her prim tailcoat shimmers with every hue.{ #40a}


The winged tiefling is [Windfall](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/windfall-veor.md), a champion of Tiamat and the proprietor of the Red Belvedere (see the accompanying stat block). A performer at heart, Windfall is ostentatious and charismatic, making small talk with regular patrons and jovially welcoming new faces to the casino.

### Meeting Windfall

As a dedicated champion of Tiamat, [Windfall](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/windfall-veor.md) has been granted phenomenal power by her master. Her skin glitters with patches of multicolored scales, and in combat, her blade sings with all five of the chromatic dragons' elements. Windfall's enchanted tailcoat shimmers with the colors of the Dragon Queen, and she uses this coat to dazzle patrons and enemies alike.

When the characters arrive at the Red Belvedere, Windfall introduces herself and answers any questions the characters have about the Red Belvedere. She provides the following information:

- **Casino.** The Red Belvedere is a decadent respite from the Blood War's horrors. Here, adventurers and devils alike can indulge in their vices in five different rooms, each with its own theme.  
- **Currency.** The Red Belvedere has its own in-house currency (see the "Casino Currency" section). Both gold and Soul Coins can be traded for in-house currency at the exchange desk in the lobby.  
- **Dragon Queen Dedication.** The casino is dedicated to Tiamat to celebrate the Dragon Queen's avarice and pride. Those who don't worship Tiamat are also welcome to partake in the casino's offerings.  
- **Rod Piece.** If the characters mention the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md), Windfall artfully dodges the topic. She claims that while the casino has been visited by several high-profile adventurers and scholars, she hasn't seen anything matching the rod piece's description. In truth, Windfall knows exactly where the final piece of the rod is: her private sanctum, adjacent to Tiamat's lair. A character who succeeds on a DC 32 Wisdom ([Insight](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check discerns only that Windfall is concealing information.  

### Where's the Rod Piece?

While inside the Red Belvedere, the character holding the sixth rod piece can determine that the seventh piece is located on the casino's premises one floor down.

The final piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) is held in Windfall's sanctum within the casino's exclusive club, Dragon's Pride. Only those personally invited by Windfall or one of the casino's pit masters are allowed inside Dragon's Pride.

If the characters ask her for permission to enter Dragon's Pride, Windfall scoffs and says they'll need to ingratiate themselves to a pit master to gain access to the exclusive area. It amuses the tiefling to watch the characters try to gain favor with at least one of the casino's pit masters (see the "Casino Pit Masters" section). Windfall is certain the characters will never convince the pit masters to let them into Dragon's Pride.

### Casino Currency

The Red Belvedere uses a special type of in-house currency known as a talon. An exchange desk in the casino's lobby allows patrons to trade in coins for talons and vice versa. One talon is worth 10 gp.

A talon looks like an iridescent metal coin stamped with the silhouette of a dragon's claw on both sides. Since the Red Belvedere is dedicated to Tiamat, each talon is imbued with a mote of the Dragon Queen's power. Carrying and exchanging talons bear unpleasant consequences:

- **Curse.** A creature that carries any number of talons is cursed. While cursed in this way, the creature has disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws as its mind is clouded by jealous and selfish thoughts. The curse ends on an affected creature only when the creature no longer holds any talons. A [Remove Curse](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic suppresses the curse's effects for 1 hour. When the curse ends on a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion), as the rampant avarice takes a physical toll.  

#### Soul Coins

The devils of the Nine Hells also use a type of currency called Soul Coins. Soul Coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to purchase favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered. A single Soul Coin can be exchanged at the casino for 300 talons and vice versa.

#### Soul Coin

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

*Soul Coins* are about 5 inches across and an inch thick, each minted from infernal iron. Each coin weighs one-third of a pound and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each *Soul Coin* has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse.

![A Soul Coin](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/126-08-003-soul-coin.webp#center)

##### Carrying Soul Coins

Anyone holding a Soul Coin feels the soul bound within itâ€”overcome with rage, fraught with despair, or whatever emotion the soul exudes.

An evil creature can carry as many *Soul Coins* as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A good or neutral creature can carry a number of *Soul Coins* equal to or less than its Constitution modifier. A non-evil creature carrying a number of *Soul Coins* greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

##### Using a Soul Coin

A Soul Coin has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a Soul Coin and do one of the following:

- **Drain Life.** You siphon away some of the soul's essence and gain `1d10` "temporary hit points".  
- **Query.** You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can always understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.  

##### Freeing a Soul

Casting [Remove Curse](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) or another spell that removes a curse on a Soul Coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the Outer Plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice).

A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A *Soul Coin* has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except damage dealt by a Hellfire Weapon or an infernal war machine's furnace.

### Casino Security

Each room of the casino is supervised by a trio of [pit fiends](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md). They are silent observers and intervene only if a patron starts a fight or is caught cheating (see the "Cheating in the Red Belvedere" sidebar).

On approaching a troublesome patron, the pit fiends confiscate the patron's talons and escort the patron from the casino. The patron is then barred from the casino for 24 hours. A barred patron can attempt to reenter by succeeding on either a DC 20 Dexterity ([Stealth](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check to avoid the pit fiends' notice or a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to convince the pit fiends to overlook the patron's past transgressions and allow reentry. Patrons barred more than once might be unable to reenter the casino for longer than 24 hours, at your discretion.

The pit fiends have no qualms about killing a patron who attacks them.

### Casino Pit Masters

A pit master presides over each room of the Red Belvedere. (The rooms of the casino are displayed on map 8.1.) The characters must gain favor with at least one pit master to access Dragon's Pride. If the characters ask the patrons milling around the casino lobby, they can learn the information presented below about each pit master.

#### Kaylan Renaudon

*Master of the Stygian Maze*

Kaylan is a devious [vampire](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vampire.md) who arrived in Avernus after dodging a group of vampire hunters on the Material Plane. When Windfall refurbished the Red Belvedere, the tiefling employed Kaylan to design the ever-shifting halls of the casino's Stygian Maze. Kaylan now presides over the maze, gleefully watching patrons wander the confounding passages in search of riches.

Kaylan has a special [Sword of Life Stealing](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sword-of-life-stealing.md) that, in addition to its usual properties, allows the vampire to draw sustenance from a soul trapped within a Soul Coin. Feeding off a *Soul Coin* in this way irrevocably destroys both the coin and the soul within, which has left Kaylan perpetually hungry for more.

##### Gaining Kaylan's Favor

Kaylan desires to feed off as many Soul Coins as he can. The characters can give Kaylan three Soul Coins in exchange for access to Dragon's Pride.

> [!note] Cheating in the Red Belvedere
> 
> Cheating by magical means is nearly impossible within the casino. Magical effects that enhance personal skill, such as Bardic Inspiration or the [Enhance Ability](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/enhance-ability.md) spell, don't directly tamper with the game and aren't considered cheating; however, casting an illusion on your hand of cards or invisibly moving dice draws the [pit fiends](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md)' attention.
> 
> Physical methods of deceit (hidden cards, weighted dice, and so on) are more likely to pass unnoticed. A character attempting to cheat in this way must make a DC 30 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check; if the character is proficient with the gaming set of the game being played, the character can make this check with advantage. On a successful check, the character bends the game to their will. Encourage the player to describe how the character successfully cheats. On a failed check, the pit fiends notice the character's attempt, confiscate the character's talons, and escort the character from the casino. A [pit fiend](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) can be placated with a minimum bribe of 250 talons or 2,500 gp.{ #cheating-in-the-red-belvedere}


#### Khai Kiroth

*Master of the Scarlet Coliseum*

Khai is a boisterous [red abishai](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/red-abishai-mpmm.md) (see appendix A) and the master of the casino's fighting pit. He relishes bloodshed, and his laughter booms over the gore-stained arena. Khai fancies himself the strongest of the pit masters, and he chafes under Windfall's leadership. Khai dedicates every death in the coliseum to Tiamat.

##### Gaining Khai's Favor

Khai prizes battle prowess above all else. Should the characters win three matches in the coliseum, Khai challenges them to combat; if the characters reduce Khai to 50 hit points or fewer without killing him, the abishai rewards them with access to Dragon's Pride. See the "Scarlet Coliseum" section later in this chapter for more information about this option.

![Rezran &quot;Snake Eyes&quot; Agrodr...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/127-08-004-rezran-khai-nyssa.webp#center "Rezran &quot;Snake Eyes&quot; Agrodro, Khai Kiroth, and Nyssa Otellion")

#### Nyssa Otellion

*Master of the Cerulean Hall*

A stoic and haughty [blue abishai](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/blue-abishai-mpmm.md) (see appendix A), Nyssa serves as the master of the casino's games of strategy and intellect. Nyssa prides herself on being an unbeatable foe in battles of wit. However, Nyssa doesn't hesitate to resort to underhanded methods to achieve victory, citing her opponent's inability to notice her cheating as a failure of intellect.

##### Gaining Nyssa's Favor

Nyssa admires those who are extremely clever and observant. See the "Cerulean Hall" section later in this chapter for more information about gaining favor with her.

#### Rezran "Snake Eyes" Agrodro

*Master of the Viridian Den*

Rezran, a greedy [green abishai](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/green-abishai-mpmm.md) (see appendix A), is the master of the casino's games of chance. His nickname "Snake Eyes" comes from his penchant for rolling ones in Triple Hydra (see the "Viridian Den" section for an explanation of the game's rules). Rezran is an opportunist to his core, always chasing after riches. He is a devoted follower of Tiamat and covets the Dragon Queen's amassed wealth.

##### Gaining Rezran's Favor

Rezran observes the characters as they partake in the Viridian Den's games. If the characters amass a total of 1,000 talons or more while in the den, Rezran is impressed with their luck and grants the characters access to Dragon's Pride.

#### Uvashar

*Master of the Alabaster Racetrack*

Uvashar is a suave, white-furred [rakshasa](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/rakshasa.md) and the master of the casino's nightmare racing circuit. Uvashar can often be found indulging in fine food and music in a private viewing box.

Duplicitous and manipulative, Uvashar likes to assume the guise of a casino patron and sow discord among the racetrack's audience members. The rakshasa rigs races to add excitement to an event. Uvashar doesn't worship Tiamat like many of the casino's pit masters and patrons, but the rakshasa nonetheless maintains a grudging allegiance to the Dragon Queen.

##### Gaining Uvashar's Favor

Uvashar holds great esteem for those who keep their promises and uphold their end of a dealâ€”especially when it requires a fair amount of skill to successfully pull off. One potential encounter to gain Uvashar's favor is presented later in the "Alabaster Racetrack" section later in the chapter.

![Kaylan Renaudon and Uvashar](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/128-08-005-kaylan-uvashar.webp#center)

## Casino Rooms

The casino's rooms are described in the following sections.

### Alabaster Racetrack

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Sleek white pillars surround what looks like a racetrack. The stands bustle with patrons, all eager to bet on the impending race.{ #423}


This arena hosts nightmare racing. Audience members can place bets, earning a payout depending on which steeds place in the top two of a given race. Up to six [nightmares](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/nightmare.md) race at any given time; those who bet on the first-place steed receive triple their initial bet, and those who bet on the second-place steed receive double their initial bet.

To simulate a race, have each participating character place a bet on a single number from 1 to 6â€”each number represents a nightmare. Roll a `d6` twice to determine which nightmares win first and second place, respectively. If both rolls are the same number, reroll one die to determine which nightmare wins second place.

#### To Cheat or Not to Cheat

A few moments after the characters enter the racetrack's area for the first time, an elf in a stylish white suit approaches them and offers them a deal. Read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Looking to make some coin, eh? So am I. I've got a little trick planned that'll cinch the race in my favor, winning me a thousand talons at least. You want in? I'll give you a cut of the winnings, and if it all goes swimmingly, I'll take you to the elite floor."{ #425}


The elf is the racetrack's pit master Uvashar (see the "Casino Pit Masters" section earlier in the chapter), concealed with an illusory disguise. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check pierces the illusion and sees the rakshasa's true appearance.

Uvashar profits regardless of which nightmare wins the race; the rakshasa merely enjoys tempting mortals with offers to cheat and observing their reactions. If the characters accept Uvashar's deal, Uvashar gives the characters a [Potion of Speed](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-speed.md) and instructs them to slip the potion into the feed of the nightmare named Sunshroud. Uvashar then points the characters in the direction of the stables.

##### Uvashar Unmasked

If any character confronts Uvashar about their disguise, Uvashar rescinds the deal, bitterly commenting that the character has ruined the fun. The rakshasa nonetheless commends the character's observation skills before leaving to find another group to toy with. The characters must find another way to gain Uvashar's favor or ingratiate themselves to another pit master.

#### Stables

The racetrack's stables are depicted on map 8.2. If the characters enter the stable area, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Six nightmares snort and paw at the ground in their respective stalls, their flaming manes dancing as devil jockeys attend to the steeds. The reeking stench of offal rises from the feed buckets. In one corner stands a bored-looking pit fiend.{ #428}


> [!gallery]
> ![Map 8.2: Alabaster Racetrack Stables](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/129-8-02-alabaster-racetrack-stables.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/130-8-02-alabaster-racetrack-stables-player.webp#gallery)

One [pit fiend](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) serves as security for the area. The six [nightmares](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/nightmare.md) (named Chicanery, Far Gambit, Blinx, Cursed Cavalry, Sunshroud, and Retribution) stamp impatiently in their stalls, and a [barbed devil](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/barbed-devil.md) jockey attends to each one.

Characters must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity ([Stealth](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check each time they enter or exit the stables to avoid being noticed and attacked by the pit fiend.

##### Rigging the Race

Successfully slipping the [Potion of Speed](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-speed.md) into Sunshroud's feed bucket requires multiple steps:

- **Step 1.** One or more characters must successfully sneak into the stables.  
- **Step 2.** After locating Sunshroud's stall, a character must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check to pour the potion into the feed bucket. On a failed check, Sunshroud and its jockey notice the character and make a ruckus, attracting the attention of the pit fiend.  
- **Step 3.** The potion reacts with the offal in the nightmare's feed bucket, causing a cloud of toxic gas to erupt. Characters within 5 feet of the feed bucket must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or have the [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for 1 hour. On a failed saving throw, the character's coughing also alerts the pit fiend.  
- **Step 4.** The characters must successfully sneak out of the stables.  

If a character executes all four steps without attracting the attention of the pit fiend, Sunshroud consumes the [Potion of Speed](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-speed.md) and wins handily.

#### Pit Master's Confrontation

If the characters successfully rig the race in Sunshroud's favor, a pit fiend approaches the party after the race. The pit fiend explains that the racetrack's pit master wants to meet with the characters, and it escorts the party to Uvashar's private viewing box. Read or paraphrase the following if the characters accompany the pit fiend to the viewing box:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This box overlooks the racetrack, far from the crowds in the stands. Charcuterie plates line the tables. Reclining in a chair is a bipedal fiend with fur like a white tiger, dressed in a sharp suit and watching you slyly.{ #42b}


Uvashar cuts straight to the point and asks the characters if they tampered with the race.

##### Telling the Truth

If the characters tell the truth, Uvashar tsks before magically appearing as the suited elf from earlier. The rakshasa admonishes the characters and dismisses them without reward. The characters must find an alternate way into Dragon's Pride.

##### Lying

A character who attempts to lie about the party's involvement must make a DC 18 Charisma ([Deception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check. On a successful check, Uvashar is impressed. On a failed check, Uvashar critiques the character's skill before laughing and commending the party's commitment. In either case, Uvashar honors the deal, offering the party access into Dragon's Pride (see the "Dragon's Pride" section later in this chapter).

### Cerulean Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Blue crystal pillars reach toward this gaming hall's ceiling. All is quiet except for the clinking of coins and shuffling of cards. Walking between tables is a lean, blue-scaled devil with dragon wings.{ #42f}


The blue devil is the room's pit master, Nyssa Otellion (see the "Casino Pit Masters" section). Nyssa stoically moves between game tables, searching for a worthy opponent.

#### Games in the Cerulean Hall

The Cerulean Hall is home to games of strategy and intellect, such as dragonchess and three-dragon ante. The room is divided into three sections based on skill: an amateur players' section, an intermediate players' section, and an expert players' section.

The minimum bet to participate in a game is 15 talons, regardless of section. At the start of a game, all participants place their starting bets in a central pot; games like dragonchess are typically limited to two participants, but other games can have five or more participants. For each turn of the game, all participants make Intelligence checks using the relevant gaming set (a dragonchess set, a playing card set, or another suitable set). The participant with the highest total roll wins the turn. In the event of a tie, no one wins the turn. The first participant who wins three turns wins the game and collects the pot.

For NPC participants, the following table shows the average bet and skill modifier to use depending on the section the NPC is playing in.

**Cerulean Hall Betting**

| Section Level | Average Bet | Modifier |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Amateur | 17 (`1d4 + 15`) talons | +4 |
| Intermediate | 20 (`2d4 + 15`) talons | +8 |
| Expert | 25 (`4d4 + 15`) talons | +12 |{ #cerulean-hall-betting}


#### A Contest of Wits

Any character who wins a game in the experts' section gains Nyssa's attention. The pit master approaches the character after the game and offers a challenge of wits. Read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Not bad. You are cleverâ€”I acknowledge that much. But I wonder how you would fare against the master of this chamber. I hereby challenge you to a dragonchess match: winner takes all."{ #432}


If the character accepts her challenge, Nyssa insists on playing the match immediately. Nyssa wagers 50 talons on this match of dragonchess, and her modifier is +12.

##### Nyssa's Cheating

Nyssa is wearing a [Medallion of Thoughts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/medallion-of-thoughts.md), which she uses to scan her opponent's surface thoughts and stay one step ahead in the match. Nyssa uses a [Disguise Self](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) spell to hide the medallion from view. As long as Nyssa's opponent can be affected by divination magic, the medallion allows Nyssa to treat any roll of a 9 or below as a 10 when she makes Intelligence checks using a dragonchess set.

A character that succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check can pierce the illusion and see the medallion, which can be identified by any character who succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence ([Arcana](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. A character that casts [Detect Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) or similar magic notices the aura of illusion magic concealing Nyssa and the medallion.

If a character accuses Nyssa of cheating, she asks the character for proof. If the character correctly identifies the medallion, Nyssa smiles widely and commends the character's ability to see through her ruse. She then concedes the match.

##### End of the Match

If the character wins the dragonchess match or Nyssa concedes, Nyssa compliments the character's intellect and thanks the character for the most thrilling match she's had in a while. She then offers the character and their companions access to Dragon's Pride (see the "Dragon's Pride" section).

If Nyssa wins, she scoffs at the character and haughtily collects her winnings.

### Scarlet Coliseum

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Jeers and shouts rise from this open-air coliseum made of deep-red stone. Over the sound of roars and clattering metal, a booming voice excitedly commentates on the fight.{ #436}


The booming voice is the magically amplified voice of Khai Kiroth, the coliseum's pit master and commentator (see the "Casino Pit Masters" section earlier in this chapter).

Watching a coliseum match is free. Matches pit two teams against each other: one consisting of creatures enlisted by the casino, the other consisting of casino patrons looking to prove their mettle in combat. Before each match, audience members can bet on which team will emerge victorious. At the conclusion of a match, audience members who bet on the winning team receive twice their initial bet.

#### Entering the Coliseum

It costs 15 talons to enter the coliseum as a combatant. A maximum of three combatants are allowed on the patrons' team. If all three combatant slots aren't filled by characters, the remaining slots are filled by [veterans](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md).

The arena matches are divided into three tiers, with victory in a tier granting access to the next one. Victory in a match goes to the side that reduces all combatants on the other side to 0 hit points. If the patrons' team wins a match, each combatant on the team receives 100 talons. The matches have one-hour breaks between them, allowing participants to take a short rest in the coliseum's wings.

Map 8.3 depicts the coliseum's arena. The three tiers of matches are as follows:

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 8.3: Scarlet Coliseum](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/131-8-03-scarlet-coliseum.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/132-8-03-scarlet-coliseum-player.webp#gallery)

- **Tier 1.** [Barlguras](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/barlgura.md) are released into the arenaâ€”one for each member of the opposing team.  
- **Tier 2.** A [purple worm](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md) erupts through the floor of the arena.  
- **Tier 3.** Two iron statues built to resemble pit fiends lumber into the arena. They use the [iron golem](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/iron-golem.md) stat block but have iron wings that give them a flying speed of 30 feet.  

If a participant wins a match but doesn't wish to continue to the next tier, the participant can pay an exit fee of 15 talons and swap with another willing participant. A participant's companions can join them in the coliseum's wings between matches.

#### Pit Master's Challenge

Characters who win three matches gain Khai's attention. Khai meets them in the coliseum's wings after the match and speaks with them. Read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "This arena hasn't seen warriors like you for quite some time. Would you indulge in one final boutâ€”against me? Truly, a special event! And, of course, I offer splendid payment for your victory. How does one thousand talons sound, along with access to our casino's exclusive club floor, Dragon's Pride?"{ #439}


Khai challenges the characters to one final arena matchâ€”against him. Since this is a special match, he allows all the characters to fight. If the characters agree, Khai declares that they shall meet in the arena in one hour.

##### Final Showdown

An excited crowd has gathered in the coliseum. Khai has two [horned devils](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md) on his team. Khai fights ruthlessly but offers cheerful commentary during the combat, lauding the characters for their skill and mocking their failings.

On being reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, Khai concedes the match, declaring the characters the victors. As promised, Khai hands the characters 1,000 talons and offers them access to Dragon's Pride (see the "Dragon's Pride" section).

![Combatants in the Scarlet ...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/133-08-006-purple-worm.webp#center "Combatants in the Scarlet Coliseum might face an irate purple worm")

### Stygian Maze

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This area's foyer is carved from glistening obsidian. An austere, fanged man in a high-collared cloak sits at an intricately carved desk, next to which is a simple stone doorway. Behind the desk, a floor-to-ceiling window overlooks a stone maze shrouded in fog.{ #43c}


The man behind the desk is the maze's pit master, the vampire Kaylan Renaudon (see the "Casino Pit Masters" section earlier in this chapter). Kaylan provides the following information:

- **Maze.** The maze challenges participants' navigational skills and adventuring prowess. Participants traverse magically shifting hallways in search of treasure, avoiding perils along the way.  
- **Participation.** Entering the maze costs 20 talons per participant. Participants can explore the maze alone or in groups.  
- **Treasure.** Treasure stashes found throughout the maze typically contain talons, though some also include Soul Coins.  

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check notices a flicker of hunger appear in Kaylan's eyes when he mentions Soul Coins. If pressed, Kaylan admits that he feeds off *Soul Coins* using a special [Sword of Life Stealing](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sword-of-life-stealing.md), which he always keeps with him. If the characters bring him *Soul Coins*, he'll give the characters 500 talons for each coin.

Bringing three or more *Soul Coins* to Kaylan earns his admiration, and he offers the characters access to Dragon's Pride in return (see the "Dragon's Pride" section).

#### Maze Features

The maze's passageways constantly move, making the maze impossible to map. All areas of the maze have the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Ceilings are solid but appear to be made of thick fog. Ceilings are 15 feet high in rooms and 10 feet high in passageways.  
- **Floor and Walls.** The floor and walls are constructed of smooth black stone.  
- **Lighting.** The maze is dimly lit by hovering globes of magical light.  
- **Room Size.** Unless otherwise stated, all chambers within the maze are circular rooms 30 feet in diameter.  

#### Navigating the Maze

Before the characters explore the maze, have them designate a leader. If a character is exploring the maze alone, that character is the leader. The leader then ventures through the maze, making a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Survival](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to discern the best pathway. On a successful check, the leader correctly navigates to a treasure chamber; roll randomly or choose an option from the Treasure Chambers table to determine what room is encountered. On a failed check, the leader stumbles into a challenge chamber; roll randomly or choose an option from the Challenge Chambers table to determine which room is encountered. Each room should be encountered only once. If you roll a result the characters have already encountered, or if the characters would leave the maze before finding a chest with one or more *Soul Coins*, reroll or choose another option.

**Treasure Chambers**

`dice: [](09-chapter-8-the-dragon-queens-pride.md#^treasure-chambers)`

| dice: d10 | Chamber |
|-----------|---------|
| 1â€“3 | A simple table sits at the center of this chamber. On the table are two [Potions of Healing (greater)](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md) and a bag of 30 talons. |
| 4â€“6 | This chamber contains a gurgling pool of turquoise water. A creature that spends 1 minute bathing in the pool gains `2d10` temporary hit points. |
| 7â€“8 | Planters filled with sweet-smelling flowers line this room. At the center of the room is an unlocked wooden chest containing 75 talons. |
| 9 | This chamber contains a locked iron chest. A character can open the chest with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check using thieves' tools, or it can be forced open with a successful DC 17 Strength ([Athletics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A [Knock](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic also opens the chest. Inside the chest are 100 talons and three Soul Coins. |
| 10 | One of this room's walls has a simple stone doorway, which leads out of the maze and returns the characters to the maze lobby. |{ #treasure-chambers}


**Challenge Chambers**

`dice: [](09-chapter-8-the-dragon-queens-pride.md#^challenge-chambers)`

| dice: d10 | Chamber |
|-----------|---------|
| 1â€“3 | Five [mimics](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/mimic.md), all disguised as treasure chests, occupy this room. Disturbing one mimic causes them all to attack. |
| 4â€“6 | This room is filled with 1-foot-deep water. A thin wooden plank spans the water, connecting the room's entrance and exit. A creature crossing the plank must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check or fall into the water. The first time a creature touches the water, three [water elementals](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) appear and attack. |
| 7â€“8 | A hostile but sleeping [behir](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/behir.md) lies curled around a chest. A creature that approaches the behir must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity ([Stealth](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check to avoid being noticed. The chest is unlocked and contains 50 talons and one Soul Coin. |
| 9 | A large vase filled with 100 talons sits in the center of the room. The vase is guarded by three [invisible stalkers](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md), which attack any creature that touches the vessel. |
| 10 | A hostile [iron golem](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/iron-golem.md) patrols this room and immediately attacks intruders. If the golem is destroyed, a character who searches the golem's remains finds three Soul Coins. |{ #challenge-chambers}


### Viridian Den

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls and ceilings of this cozy den are made of luminescent jade. Rowdy patrons gather around game tables, scowling at dice and cards as they test their luck. A green-scaled draconic devil moves between games, idly chatting with players.{ #440}


The green devil is the room's pit master, Rezran Agrodro (see the "Casino Pit Masters" section). Rezran observes the room, occasionally swooping in to speak with a patron who's on a winning streak.

#### Pit Master's Favor

If the characters have 1,000 talons or more and are in the Viridian Den, Rezran is impressed and invites them to Dragon's Pride.

#### Games in the Viridian Den

The characters can partake in two games while visiting the Viridian Den.

##### Drake's Auction

This card game has a minimum bet of 20 talons, which goes into a pot at the center of the table. The goal of the game is to amass the highest-ranking hand of cards.

At the start of the game, the croupier deals each participant a pair of cards. The croupier draws three cards to lay face up next to the pot; these cards are up for auction. Participants bid on the auction cards, and the participant with the highest bid wins the card and adds their bid to the pot. Once all three auction cards have been sold, all participants reveal their hands, and the highest-ranking hand wins the whole pot.

To simulate play of this game, have each participant roll `2d12` in secret. Then, roll `3d12` and show the numbers rolledâ€”these represent the auction cards. On winning a bid, the participant can add the number rolled on the die won to their total roll. At the end of the game, the participant with the highest total wins. If the highest totals are tied, no one wins.

##### Triple Hydra

The minimum bet for this game is 25 talons. In this dice game, each participant rolls `3d6`. If the participant rolls none of the same number, the participant wins nothing. If the participant rolls two of the same number, the participant wins an amount equal to twice their starting bet. If the participant rolls three of the same number, the participant wins an amount equal to triple their starting bet.

If a participant rolls two or more 1s, this roll is called snake eyes. In addition to the normal payout, a participant who rolls snake eyes also gets an additional payout equal to their starting bet.

## Dragon's Pride

Occupying the lower floor of the Red Belvedere, Dragon's Pride is an exclusive club reserved for the casino's most valued patrons. Here, club members can spend talons on opulent jewelry, refreshing cocktails, and rejuvenating spa treatments.

This floor is also home to the casino proprietor's office, which connects to a hidden sanctum used to communicate directly with Tiamat. Within this sanctum, Windfall keeps the final piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md), hoping to amplify the rod's ability to cast [Simulacrum](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/simulacrum.md) with Tiamat's power and re-create her master's beloved lost creation: Sardior, the ruby dragon.

### Entering Dragon's Pride

Dragon's Pride occupies the lower floor of the casino and is accessed via an elevator. This elevator is magically concealed within the back of the large dragon statue in the casino's lobby. To view the elevator's entrance and pass through, a creature must bear the club's mark: an enchanted tattoo of a dragon claw. Only Windfall and the casino's pit masters can bestow or remove this tattoo. As soon as the tiefling or a pit master grants permission to enter Dragon's Pride, the mark magically appears on a creature's hand. To creatures lacking the mark, the club's elevator is undetectable and impassable by any other means.

Once the characters have gained favor with at least one of the casino's pit masters, that pit master marks each of the characters with the club's tattoo and instructs the characters to head through the back of the lobby's statue. Now bearing the club's mark, the characters can see the entrance to Dragon's Pride:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> What was once a solid statue now appears translucent. Within, a stone platform slowly levitates between this floor and the one below.{ #448}


As long as they bear the mark, the characters can enter and exit Dragon's Pride at their leisure.

### Features of Dragon's Pride

Unless otherwise stated, the areas of Dragon's Pride have the following features.

#### Ceilings, Floors, and Walls

The ceilings, floors, and walls are carved from smooth red stone that's slightly warm to the touch. The ceilings are 15 feet high unless otherwise noted.

#### Lighting

Rooms are brightly lit by multicolored magical sconces. Tapping a sconce turns it off.

#### Security

A [pit fiend](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) stands guard in each room. The pit fiends are silent observers who intervene if a fight breaks out.

#### Wards

Magical wards surround Dragon's Pride. If a creature without the club's mark attempts to teleport into Dragon's Pride, the creature takes 33 (`6d10`) psychic damage, and the attempt fails.

### Dragon's Pride Locations

The areas of Dragon's Pride are keyed to map 8.4.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 8.4: Dragon's Pride](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/134-8-04-dragons-pride.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/135-8-04-dragons-pride-player.webp#gallery)

#### N1: Wyrmsong Cantina

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Lavish couches surround low tables in this dimly lit lounge. At the center of the room is a circular bar. Liquor bottles on shelves flash colors in time with faintly playing jazz, while a frost-blue devil pours drinks behind the bar.{ #450}


The bartender is an [ice devil](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/ice-devil.md) named Oganath, who uses its frigid claws to instantly chill the drinks it serves. At any given time, `2d4` [horned devils](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md) relax in the lounge.

##### Oganath's Cocktails

An expert in arcane mixology, Oganath serves a myriad of magic drinks at the bar:

- **Blazing Bloody Jack (Costs 100 Talons).** Motes of coagulated, red juice are suspended throughout this amber-colored cocktail, which tastes both sweet and spicy. When consumed, this drink functions as a [Potion of Heroism](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-heroism.md).  
- **Joker's Sky (Costs 125 Talons).** This lustrous blue drink is topped with fluffy, white cream. When consumed, this drink functions as a [Potion of Flying](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-flying.md).  
- **Salubra Slinger (Costs 50 Talons).** This fizzy, berry-flavored drink causes the imbiber's mouth to feel slightly numb. When consumed, this drink functions as an [Elixir of Health](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/elixir-of-health.md).  

A drink loses its magic if it is removed from the Red Belvedere. Oganath also offers a variety of mundane cocktails, which cost 3 talons each.

#### N2: Enchanting Arcana

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A sleek rakshasa in shimmering teal robes runs this arcane jewelry store. Elegant, bejeweled accessories are displayed for sale on the counter.{ #453}


The store is run by a vainglorious [rakshasa](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/rakshasa.md) lapidary named Krysocol, who has several pieces for sale:

- Two black jade pendants (each an [Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location.md)) for 300 talons each  
- A brass necklace hung with citrine spheres (a [Necklace of Fireballs](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/necklace-of-fireballs.md) with five beads) for 1,250 talons  
- A purple ring with white diamond stars (a [Ring of Shooting Stars](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/ring-of-shooting-stars.md)) for 2,000 talons  

##### Forged in Hell

Any magic item created by Krysocol bears the following additional effect, which the rakshasa is loath to disclose:

- **Curse.** As long as you wear this item, you are cursed. The item can't be removed until you are targeted by a [Remove Curse](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. While cursed in this way, every time you finish a long rest, you must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you immediately drop everything you are carrying or wearing and are transformed into a [lemure](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/lemure.md). Only a [Wish](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell can reverse this transformation.  

#### N3: Virtuous Vices

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Fluffy clouds of steam billow from this spa, redolent of ginger and citrus. Two erinyesâ€”one in a white robe, one in blackâ€”stand behind the counter. Behind them are several hot springs and massage stations.{ #456}


The spa is run by two [erinyes](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) named Vitia and Vertu. They offer two services:

- **Brimstone Springs (Costs 100 Talons).** This service takes 1 hour and includes a relaxing hot spring bath and massage. A creature who partakes in this service gains `4d10 + 4` "temporary hit points" in addition to the benefits of a short rest.  
- **Luxe Reawakening (Costs 450 Talons).** This rejuvenating service takes 3 hours. A creature who partakes in this service gains `6d10 + 6` "temporary hit points" in addition to the benefits of a long rest.  

#### N4: Windfall's Office

The door to the office is locked and guarded by two [pit fiends](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md). Each pit fiend standing guard also carries a key to the office door for emergency purposes. Opening the door without the proper key requires thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check, or a [Knock](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic.

If the office door is opened by any means other than the key, its trap activates, spraying colorless poisonous gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 18 (`4d8`) poison damage. This trap can't be disarmed.

The office's interior is devoid of occupants. When the characters venture inside, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Bookshelves line the walls of this room. A bed draped in plush linens is built into an alcove, across from which is a simple work desk covered in papers and books. Mounted on the back wall is the sculpted bust of a smiling red dragon.{ #458}


The desk is covered with notes about magical constructs, as well as religious and historical texts written in Draconic. A character who spends 10 minutes studying these items learns the following:

- **The First World.** Tiamat worked alongside the platinum dragon Bahamut to shape the Material Plane in the form of a single First World. An unknown cataclysm sundered this First World, resulting in the numerous universes now occupying the Material Plane.  
- **The Ruby Dragon.** While creating the First World, Bahamut and Tiamat also created Sardior, a dragon with ruby scales. Sardior was destroyed in the sundering of the First World.  
- **The Simulacrum Project.** Windfall acquired the [seventh piece](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) some time ago. She used it to create an image of Sardior, who she believes resembled a red dragon. Windfall hopes to find a way to use the rod piece to bring the image to life.  

##### Secret Entrance

The bust on the wall projects an illusion that conceals the entrance to the Ruby Sanctum (area N5). A [See Invisibility](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/see-invisibility.md) spell or similar magic reveals the entryway's outline in the wall. A character searching the room for secret doors finds this hidden entrance with a successful DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check.

##### Treasure

Most of the items in Windfall's office are lavish but mundane and too big to transport. However, a character who searches the room finds a [Tome of Leadership and Influence](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/tome-of-leadership-and-influence.md) tucked into a bookcase.

#### N5: Ruby Sanctum

![A holographic red dragon s...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/136-08-007-red-dragon.webp#center "A holographic red dragon sleeps next to the final rod piece")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this cavernous space are made of faceted, ruby-red crystal. A thin tunnel juts from the back of the cavern and leads into darkness.
> 
> A stalagmite rises from the floor in the center of the room. A similarly sized stalactite hangs from the ceiling directly above it. The space between the two is occupied by a crystalline rod piece pulsing with energy. The piece projects the holographic image of a sleeping red dragon. Windfall stands near the projection, watching it intently.{ #45c}


The ceilings in this chamber are 45 feet high. [Windfall](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/windfall-veor.md) is hostile to trespassers in the sanctum.

The crystalline object floating between the stalagmite and stalactite is the [final piece](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md). Attempting to remove the rod piece from its position immediately causes the image of the dragon to disappear, prompting Windfall to attack.

##### Draconic Intervention

When Windfall is first reduced to 0 hit points, multicolored light surrounds her as five hissing voices echo throughout the chamber:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Upstart insects! Who dares make a racket outside my lair? Who dares interrupt the musings of the Dragon Queen?"{ #45e}


The facets of the sanctum's walls reflect images of Tiamat's eyes as she talks. Windfall regains 300 hit points but has the [paralyzed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) condition due to Tiamat's magic as the Dragon Queen speaks to the characters directly.

##### Retrieving the Rod Piece

If the characters inform Tiamat of Vecna's plot, Tiamat growls in disdain before grudgingly allowing the characters to leave with the final piece of the rod. She explains that the Material Plane is partly her creationâ€”and she refuses to let an overzealous archlich unmake it. The Dragon Queen then commands the characters to leave the casino at once.

Otherwise, Tiamat releases Windfall from her magical restraints, instructs the tiefling to eradicate the party, and leaves to commune with her other champions. Only after Windfall is defeated can the characters acquire the final piece of the rod. For more about the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md), see this book's introduction.

##### To Tiamat's Lair

The narrow tunnel to the south eventually leads to Tiamat's lair. This entrance is currently guarded by Drekarvynix, an [ancient red dragon](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-red-dragon.md), who demands the characters leave unless they can prove their legitimate business in Tiamat's lair. Unless the characters provide a compelling reason to enter, Drekarvynix attacks them. The red dragon doesn't pursue the characters back through the tunnel to Dragon's Pride.

## Next Steps

Once the characters have retrieved the last piece of the rod, they can go back to the doorway through the mountainside cliff in Avernus and return to Sigil without further complications.
