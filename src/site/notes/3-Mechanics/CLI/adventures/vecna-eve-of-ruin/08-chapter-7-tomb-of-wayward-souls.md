# Chapter 7: Tomb of Wayward Souls
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin* 

![The next rod piece lurks d...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/106-07-001-the-tomb-of-wayward-souls.webp#center "The next rod piece lurks deep in the deadly Tomb of Wayward Souls")

Retrieving the sixth piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) leads the characters to a chain of tropical islands on the world of Oerth. There, the party must plumb the depths of a deadly complex called the Tomb of Wayward Souls, which was built to lure in and slay treasure-seekers. This labyrinthine maze of deadly traps was crafted by the diabolical archlich Acererak, who takes perverse pleasure in littering his dungeons with the bones of defeated adventurers.

## Running This Chapter

This chapter begins after the characters retrieve the fifth piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md). A character who holds that piece instinctively knows that the sixth piece is located on the Isle of Serpents on Oerth, a world known for its legendary dungeons and magical treasures.

The characters arrive on the island in time to witness a battle between a [kraken](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/kraken.md) and a crew of archaeologists. The archaeologists are in dire straits, and it's up to the characters to decide whether to help. Eventually, the characters realize that the sixth piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) is located in the complex the archaeologists were exploring: the Tomb of Wayward Souls.

The archaeologists haven't explored far into the deadly complex, so the characters must face its challenges without much information. The search for the rod piece culminates in a showdown with Rerak, an empowered simulacrum of Acererak.

### Character Advancement

The characters should be 16th level when this chapter begins. The characters gain a level after they retrieve the sixth rod piece from the Tomb of Wayward Souls.

### Power of Secrets

The characters can learn two secrets in this chapter that are applicable to the rules in "The Power of Secrets" section in this book's introduction:

- **Marian's Secret.** Marian Xavere, one of the archaeologists, holds a lifelong fascination with Acererak and the archlich's evil magic, and she was previously tempted to study necromancy. See the "Archaeologist Camp" section later in this chapter for more information.  
- **Rerak's Secret.** The false lich resents his imprisonment in the Tomb of Wayward Souls and never wanted to enact Acererak's will. Rerak is the guardian of the rod piece the characters seek and waits in area T26 of the complex.  

### Sixth Rod Piece

The [sixth piece](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) is in area T27 of the Tomb of Wayward Souls. For more information about the rod and the spell this rod piece allows its wielder to cast, see this book's introduction.

## Oerth

This chapter takes place on Oerth, in the Greyhawk campaign setting. The world is rife with elaborate dungeons, magical treasures, and other fantastical hallmarks of sword and sorcery.

### Isle of Serpents

Characters who research the Isle of Serpents in Sigil can learn the following:

- **Acererak's Machinations.** Long ago, the archlich Acererak visited the Isle of Serpents in his search for precious artifacts. Acererak demolished settlements across the island, stealing treasures and killing indiscriminately. He then built one of his infamous tombs near the coast. The descendants of those who survived Acererak's onslaught remain on the island and are still working to rebuild. Many seek to reclaim the treasures that were stolen from them.  
- **Geography.** The Isle of Serpents is a part of an archipelago known as the Asperdi-Duxchan Chain. The island's temperate climate creates a haven for venomous snakes and poisonous fauna, and its craggy cliffs contain treacherous coastal cave systems.  
- **Inhabitants.** Popular accounts of the island describe it as unlucky, leading outsiders to avoid it. (The island's inhabitants know this rumor is false, though likely tied to Acererak's long-ago activities, and most families have been here for many generations. The characters learn this when they visit the island.)  
- **Legends.** Legends speak of Acererak's infamous Tomb of Horrors, a deadly labyrinth filled with monsters and puzzles. Stories state that the archlich created similar tombs to guard precious magical artifacts. One such tomb is located on the isle.  

## Down to Oerth

When the party steps through the Sigil portal to the Isle of Serpents, they emerge through a ground-level opening in a cliff. The opening overlooks a lagoon, as shown on map 7.1.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 7.1: Isle of Serpents Lagoon](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/107-7-01-isle-of-serpents-lagoon.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/108-7-01-isle-of-serpents-lagoon-player.webp#gallery)

### Kraken Attack!

The characters arrive in the midst of chaos on the lagoon's beach. Read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You feel warm sea air as you gaze upon the craggy shore of an island lagoon. Rising from the lagoon's depths are tentacles that lash toward the beach at a group of panicked people dressed in hiking gear.{ #378}


The tentacles belong to a [kraken](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/kraken.md) that took damage in an altercation with a hunting boat earlier and has been reduced to 250 hit points. It was lurking off the lagoon's coast when a group of archaeologists stopped here to fish. Hungry and irate, the kraken ambushed the people, who are desperately trying to escape. The kraken is positioned along the easternmost portion of the 100-foot-deep water shown on map 7.1. The archaeologists are scattered throughout the 2-foot-deep water and along the beach.

There are fifteen human and elf archaeologists on the beach. With the exception of Laysa Matulin, Talo Yieria, Vogren Starcloak, and Marian Xavere (who are described in the following sections), the archaeologists use the [commoner](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block.

If the characters join the battle, the [kraken](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/kraken.md) focuses on them while the archaeologists retreat. If the characters don't join the battle, the kraken gobbles up eight of the archaeologists before sinking into the lagoon, satisfied. Laysa, Talo, Vogren, and Marian are among the survivors.

#### Meeting Laysa Matulin

When the kraken is no longer a threat, the leader of the archaeologists approaches the characters.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A stout human woman with bronze skin and curly dark hair held back with a colorful scarf runs toward you. Her expression is a mixture of relief and excitement.{ #37a}


Laysa is a chaotic good, human, pirate-turned-archaeologist (use the [assassin](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) stat block). Descended from the island's original inhabitants, Laysa seeks to reclaim the treasures stolen from her ancestors. She recruited a crew to help her explore the complex where she believes the treasures are held.

Laysa invites the characters to the archaeologists' camp to rest and chat.

![A kraken attacks people on the Isle of Serpents](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/109-07-001-isle-of-serpents.webp#center)

### Archaeologist Camp

The archaeologists set their camp on the beach to the lagoon's south, where the cliff gives way and allows passage inland. Describe the camp as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The tents here sit between the shore and the jungle. Armor and digging equipment lie scattered across the sand. To one side, two men—an elf and an orc—tend to wounded colleagues. They each have a symbol of an arc of seven stars hanging from their necks, and their hands glow with divine magic. On the opposite side of camp, a human woman pores over a spellbook.{ #37c}


The archaeologists are investigating the ancient complex in which a piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) waits. The characters can chat with the archaeologists to learn about the complex and ask to borrow magic items to aid their quest.

#### Laysa's Goals

At camp, Laysa is happy to share what she knows. She volunteers the following information:

- **Foreign Complex.** The complex's architectural style is different than local traditions, so the complex must have been built by an outsider. Based on the complex's defenses, Laysa believes something valuable is held within.  

![Laysa Matulin](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/110-07-002-laysa-matulin.webp#center)

- **Some Progress.** Laysa's crew uncovered the complex's entrance, as well as two false entrances laden with traps. The archaeologists haven't been able to explore much more, but they think they've identified how to delve farther into the complex.  
- **Stolen Treasures.** Long ago, an evil mage with a skeletal appearance demolished Laysa's ancestral village on this island. The mage absconded with several treasures and was never seen again.  

Laysa is unfamiliar with the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md), but she agrees that such a powerful magic item could be found within the complex. She isn't aware of any other location where the rod piece might be.

Laysa provides the characters with a rough map of the complex (map 7.2) and can lead the party to its entrance when they're ready.

##### Stolen Treasures

Laysa hopes to recover six ancestral treasures stolen from her people. Some of these treasures are magic items, although Laysa describes them only as detailed below. The items (and their locations on map 7.3) are as follows:

- Ebony wand decorated with bones and feathers (area T9)  
- Ring of golden stars (area T13)  
- Sacred scimitar dedicated to serpent spirits (area T17)  
- Set of copper tablets engraved with incantations (area T19)  
- Crystal orb used in rituals (area T23)  
- Blue silk sash used in ceremonies (area T27)  

If the characters uncover any of these items from the complex and return them to Laysa, she is ecstatic. For each item returned, Laysa pays the characters five gemstones worth 500 gp apiece. She keeps the gemstones in a pouch that hangs from her belt.

#### Talo Yieria and Vogren Starcloak, Priests and Healers

The elf man is Talo Yieria, and the orc man is Vogren Starcloak. Both are neutral good [priests](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) of Celestian, the enigmatic deity of stars and wanderers on Oerth. Though apprehensive about exploring the complex, the couple are dear friends to Laysa and support her efforts.

Talo and Vogren are well versed in the religious history of the island. If asked, they provide the following advice:

- **Reciprocity.** Powerful nature spirits reside on the island and don't take kindly to those who would exploit it. No one should take anything without leaving something in return.  
- **Respect.** Offerings of money, food, or crafted items show respect to the island's spirits. Acts of kindness can also gain the spirits' favor.  

Should the characters return to the camp partway through exploring the complex, Talo and Vogren offer to use magic to heal them.

#### Marian Xavere, Resident Mage

The human woman poring over a spellbook is the camp's resident arcana expert, Marian Xavere (neutral [mage](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)). Hailing from the mainland, Marian joined Laysa's crew because of her intense fascination with magical traps and artifacts.

Marian's arcane research led her to study Acererak, and she can tell the characters about the archlich. The characters learn the information about Acererak presented in this chapter and in Acererak's entry in appendix B. Marian doesn't realize exactly how dangerous the complex here is.

##### Magic Items

Marian has a [Lantern of Revealing](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/lantern-of-revealing.md) sitting near her and a [Gem of Seeing](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/gem-of-seeing.md) strapped to her belt. If asked, she lends the characters the lantern but is hesitant to lend the gem. A character can convince her to lend them the [Gem of Seeing](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/gem-of-seeing.md) by succeeding on a DC 18 Charisma ([Persuasion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

##### Marian's Secret

When the characters speak at length with Marian, they notice the mage speaks enthusiastically, but somewhat guiltily, about Acererak. If the characters remark on or ask about this, Marian admits that she once admired the archlich and even considered studying necromancy. When Marian realized the great evil involved, though, she eschewed this grim path.

Regardless of the characters' reaction to this revelation, learning it counts as a secret for the purposes of the Power of Secrets rules in this book's introduction.

![Map 7.2: Tomb Complex](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/111-map-7-02-tomb-complex.webp#center)

## Into the Tomb

After devastating the island's native villages, Acererak constructed one of his tombs here. Though outsiders rarely visited the Isle of Serpents, whispers of an island complex laden with treasures spread across Oerth. Over time, this complex became known as the Tomb of Wayward Souls, since explorers would venture inside only to die.

Laysa and her crew made some progress exploring the complex, demarking the false entrances and traps. The complex's entrance is about 1 mile from the archaeologists' camp.

### Features of the Tomb

Unless otherwise stated, the areas of the complex have the following features.

#### Ceilings, Doors, Floors, and Walls

The ceilings, floors, and walls of the complex are constructed from limestone. Chamber ceilings are 20 feet high, while hallway ceilings are 10 feet high. Doors are wooden and unlocked unless otherwise specified; some must be opened by special means. The complex's walls are immune to any spell or magical effect that would change their shape, such as a [Passwall](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/passwall.md) or [Stone Shape](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/stone-shape.md) spell.

#### Hidden Doors

Illusion magic conceals many of the complex's doors, making them look like solid walls. These hidden doors are detectable by touch, and creatures with [truesight](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Truesight) see the doors as if they weren't hidden. Casting [Dispel Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) on a hidden door permanently removes the magic concealing it. A hidden door is otherwise identical to other doors in the complex. Locations of hidden doors are marked on map 7.3.

#### Lighting

The interior of the complex is brightly lit by crystal sconces holding eerie green flames. The flames can't be extinguished by any means.

#### Planar Trammels

When a creature within the complex casts a spell or uses an effect that would transport itself or another creature to a different plane (such as casting [Astral Projection](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/astral-projection.md), [Banishment](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/banishment.md), [Etherealness](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/etherealness.md), or [Plane Shift](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md)), the spell slot and components, item charges, or other resources are expended as normal, but nothing happens.

#### The Rod Piece and Its Guardian

The sixth piece of the rod can be found in area T27. The piece is guarded by Rerak, an empowered simulacrum of Acererak designed to harvest souls for the archlich. When an adventurer dies in the complex, Rerak traps their soul using foul magic and shunts it to the gems embedded in the false lich's eyes. The souls remain in the false lich's eyes for 24 hours, after which the souls are transferred to Acererak and are trapped forever. Rerak also resets traps that adventurers have triggered in the complex.

A long time has passed since the archlich created Rerak. The simulacrum is torn between dutifully fulfilling Acererak's will and resenting the archlich for imprisoning him within this complex. Retrieving the rod piece requires confronting Rerak in his crypt, though the characters can recover the piece without fighting the simulacrum. For more information about confronting Rerak, see area T26.

##### Corrupted Mirages

Rerak's resentment, intermingled with the magic of the rod piece, causes strange mirages to appear throughout the complex. These mirages are described where they're encountered (see areas T9, T13, T21, and T24).

### Tomb Locations

The areas of the tomb are keyed to map 7.3.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 7.3: Tomb of Wayward Souls](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/112-7-03-tomb-of-wayward-souls.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/113-7-03-tomb-of-wayward-souls-player.webp#gallery)

#### T1: False Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This wide corridor ends at two stone doors with metal handles. At the entrance, the archaeologists posted symbols for "danger" and "fire."{ #38d}


The doors at the end of the corridor are fake and can't be opened. Behind them is a solid wall.

##### Explosion Trap

A creature that steps inside the corridor triggers a trap. When the creature touches the corridor floor, the floor tiles depress, and a slab of stone lodged in the ceiling lowers to the ground, sealing the corridor before flooding it with magical fire. Each creature inside the closed-off corridor must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (`8d6`) fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The stone slab seals off the corridor until the next dawn, when the slab rises into its ceiling cavity and the trap resets. In the meantime, a creature can use an action to try to lift the slab, creating a passable opening with a successful DC 18 Strength ([Athletics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

#### T2: False Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Strange pockmarks line the walls of this corridor, at the end of which is a set of dark wooden doors.{ #390}


##### Arrow Trap

Spring-loaded arrows are hidden in the pockmarked walls. A creature that enters the trapped area marked on map 7.3 for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there triggers a fusillade of arrows and must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (`6d8`) piercing damage from the arrows on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The 5-foot-wide area along the east wall is outside the trap's area and safe to stand in.

##### Doors' Secret

The doors at the end of the hallway are fake and can't be opened. Tiny text is scrawled on the doors' front:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Acererak commends you! Alas, these doors lead nowhere, but your skill shall not go unrewarded. Should you wish to plumb the depths of my tomb, heed these words: the blue one craves your magic."{ #393}


This is a clue for opening the door in area T4.

#### T3: Tomb Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This hallway has been partially excavated. Lifted stone lids reveal a ten-foot-deep pit filled with spikes in the center of the corridor. A thin plank of wood is laid over the pit to allow for safe crossing.{ #395}


Characters can use the wooden plank to cross the pit safely. A creature that falls into the pit takes 5 (`1d10`) piercing damage from the spikes, which turn the floor of the pit into "difficult terrain".

At the bottom of the pit, situated in the middle of its northeast wall, is a hidden door that leads to area T5.

#### T4: Face of the Great Blue Devil

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A relief of a scowling, fiendish face made of azure mosaic tiles spans the hallway's back wall. The face's mouth is open, revealing a black maw, and its eyes are carved from clouded white crystal. To the right of the mosaic is a closed door.{ #397}


A character who examines the relief with a [Detect Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell or similar magic finds that the relief's mouth radiates conjuration magic and its eyes radiate abjuration magic.

##### Mouth Portal

The relief's mouth is 10 feet wide and several feet tall. Objects and creatures that enter the relief's mouth are teleported to area T14.

##### Opening the Devil's Door

The relief is the key to opening the door to area T6. The door can be opened in no other way.

When a creature standing within 5 feet of the relief casts a spell using a spell slot, the spell slot is expended as normal, but the spell has no effect. Instead, the magic is absorbed by the relief, filling it with a number of charges equal to the level of spell slot expended and causing the relief's eyes to glow green. Once the relief has absorbed 6 or more charges, the door opens. The door closes on its own after 10 minutes unless it is held or wedged open. When the door closes, the relief's eyes stop glowing, and opening the door again from this area requires the expenditure of more spell slots. The door can be opened from the east side like any normal door.

#### T5: Cave of Seven Casks

![A cryptic message written ...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/114-07-003-seven-casks.webp#center "A cryptic message written in Celestial provides clues about how to use the seven casks in a nearby cave")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Crooked wooden planks line the floor of this cave. Seven casks are embedded along one wall. Each cask has a different symbol painted on it, with a spigot beneath it. Cups and tankards line shelves on the opposite wall.{ #39b}


A character who studies the shelves notices a repeating message carved in Celestial along the shelves' edges:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "A septet of libations I present to you,
> 
> But only one will help you escape this tomb.
> 
> Six drinks are magic; one is mundane.
> 
> Those marked with stars are vitality's bane.
> 
> Blue is neither blessing nor curse.
> 
> Moon cleanses you of illness or worse.
> 
> Green's neighbor is never boring—
> 
> Drink deep; pass through the flooring."{ #39c}


The message gives clues as to the casks' contents.

Each cask contains 20 pints of liquor. In order from left to right, the casks are marked with the following symbols:

- **Green Star.** The liquor in this cask is infused with necromantic magic. A creature that drinks any amount of the liquor must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (`5d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **Blue Square.** A creature that drinks a pint or more of the liquor in this cask gains the benefit of a [Potion of Diminution](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-diminution.md). A character reduced to Tiny size by the liquor can't fit through the narrow gaps between the floorboards (see the "Tunnel to Area T8" section for more information).  
- **Green Crescent Moon.** A creature that drinks a pint or more of the liquor in this cask gains the benefit of an [Elixir of Health](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/elixir-of-health.md).  
- **Red Square.** A creature that drinks a pint or more of the liquor in this cask gains the benefit of a [Potion of Gaseous Form](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-gaseous-form.md). A character in gaseous form can easily pass through the narrow gaps between the floorboards (see "Tunnel to Area T8" below).  
- **Blue Circle.** A creature that drinks a pint or more of the liquor in this cask gains the benefit of a [Potion of Growth](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-growth.md).  
- **Green Circle.** The liquor is this cask is not magical, but it is toxic. A creature that drinks any amount of the liquor must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or have the [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for 1 hour.  
- **Red Star.** The liquor in this cask acts as a magical paralytic. Upon drinking any amount from this cask, a creature must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or have the [paralyzed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) condition for 1 hour.  

Liquor removed from this cave immediately loses its magical properties. Removing a cask from this room causes the liquor within the cask to evaporate.

##### Tunnel to Area T8

Characters who examine the floor can see an empty basement through the 1-inch cracks between the floorboards. The basement has a tunnel exiting to the east, toward area T8. The easiest way to reach this tunnel is to drink from the cask marked with the red square to adopt a cloudlike form. The floorboards are otherwise immovable and immune to all damage.

If the characters have trouble solving the puzzle, any character who walks across the floorboards realizes that the only way past this room is through the thin gaps between the floorboards. If the characters still struggle, allow them to make a DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check to determine that the magical liquor in one or more of the casks might facilitate travel through the cracks between the floorboards.

#### T6: Hall of Gemstones

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Rows of colorful jewels line this corridor's walls. At the east end stands an emerald-colored statue of a crashing wave, the words "This wave is green" carved into its base. A door is set in the corridor's south wall.{ #39f}


Close inspection of the statue uncovers a divot in the statue's base big enough to hold one jewel.

##### Gemstone Puzzle

All the jewels embedded in the walls are made of worthless crystal except for one: an emerald worth 1,000 gp. A character who spends at least 1 minute examining the jewels spots the emerald with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. Prying the emerald from its wall socket is easily done. Placing the emerald in the statue opens the door sealing off the passage to area T16. The door resists all other attempts to open it. Once opened, however, it ceases to be locked and can thereafter be opened and closed without the emerald.

A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recalls that emeralds are used to contain water elementals.

Whenever a creature touches one of the other jewels embedded in the walls, the statue glows and launches a blast of freezing magic down the hallway in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (`6d10`) cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### T7: Skeleton Closet

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A moldering skeleton draped in cobwebs sits in one corner of this small room. A gold choker set with a large black stone hangs around the skeleton's neck.{ #3a2}


If examined with a [Detect Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell or similar effect, the necklace radiates an aura of necromancy magic.

##### Necklace Trap

The first time a creature touches the necklace, it releases a burst of deathly energy in a 5-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (`8d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Once the trap has been triggered, the necklace becomes a mundane choker worth 1,200 gp.

#### T8: Room of Myriad Archways

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Each wall of this octagonal room contains a stone archway. A veil of white fog fills the room.{ #3a5}


The fog is magical and can't be cleared or dispelled.

##### Archways

The archways lead to the following destinations:

- **North Archway.** Any creature or object that enters this one-way portal is teleported to area T3, appearing at the southwest end of the corridor or the nearest unoccupied space.  
- **Northeast Archway.** This archway connects to area T11. The tunnel leading there is made of smooth, gray stone.  
- **East Archway.** Any creature or object that enters this one-way portal is teleported to an unoccupied space in area T20a. If there's not enough space in that location for the creature or object, it is unable to pass through the portal and is rebuffed instead.  
- **Southeast Archway.** This archway connects to area T7 via a hidden doorway. The tunnel beyond the archway is made of obsidian and covered in cobwebs.  
- **South Archway.** Any creature or object that enters this one-way portal is teleported to a random unoccupied space in area T14.  
- **Southwest Archway.** This archway connects to a basement under the floorboards of area T5 via a dirt tunnel.  
- **West Archway.** Any creature or object that enters this one-way portal is teleported to an unoccupied space in area T20b. If there's not enough space in that location for the creature or object, it is unable to pass through the portal and is rebuffed instead.  
- **Northwest Archway.** This archway connects to area T9. The tunnel leading there is covered with moss.  

#### T9: Forest of Spirits Mirage

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You arrive at an expansive glade of trees. Bobbing lights flit between the branches, and at the center of the glade stands a towering banyan tree wrapped in sickly looking vines. A path winds through the glade but disappears when you try to focus closely on it.{ #3a8}


The banyan tree is a neutral [treant](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant.md) named Abalahin. Abalahin is real, while the rest of the forest is a mirage. The mirage is tactile, so creatures can interact with it.

##### Piercing the Illusion

The mirage is linked to Abalahin's existence. If Abalahin is killed, the mirage ends, revealing the room to be a stone chamber containing Abalahin's remains.

##### Befriending Abalahin

Abalahin is covered with strangling vines that render the treant sluggish and distant. A [Remove Curse](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar effect causes the blighted vines around Abalahin to dissolve. Once the vines are gone, Abalahin is grateful to the characters and, in return, suppresses the mirage, revealing the room's exits.

##### Bobbing Spirit Lights

There are `1d8` bobbing spirit lights (each uses the [will-o'-wisp](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/will-o-wisp.md) stat block and speaks Common and Sylvan) that fill the illusory glade at any given time. The spirit lights are part of the mirage, are indifferent to the characters' presence, and disappear if attacked. Any character with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 17 or higher discerns the spirit lights whispering and overhears one of the following remarks:

![+3 Wand of the War Mage](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/115-07-004-wand-of-the-war-mage.webp#center)

- "The next challenge is crushing—move fast!"  
- "The master of this tomb longs to be free. Wouldn't you, if you were he?"  
- "Steal not from the library, for it holds trouble."  
- "Illusions are we, born from a mix of wanderlust and corrupted magic. Many more can you find in this forgotten place."  
- "The jade serpents crave offerings."  

##### Treasure

Close inspection of Abalahin's roots reveals an ebony wand decorated with bones and feathers (a [+3 Wand of the War Mage](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/3-wand-of-the-war-mage.md)). A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can convince Abalahin to relinquish the wand voluntarily. The wand can also be removed without attracting Abalahin's notice by a character who succeeds on a DC 25 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. The wand is one of the treasures Laysa mentioned earlier in this chapter.

Abalahin is hostile toward creatures it catches trying to steal the wand. Once the treant has been defeated, the wand can easily be retrieved.

#### T10: Crushing Room Trap

This room appears to be empty. When one or more characters enter the room, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A click sounds from above. The room's ceiling begins descending rapidly.{ #3ae}


The 20-foot-high ceiling drops suddenly, stopping 6 inches above the floor before rising just as quickly and plummeting again. This rapid, piston-like movement lasts for 1 minute, after which the ceiling returns to its original height and locks in place until the trap is triggered again.

Each time the trap triggers, have the characters roll initiative. The ceiling drops to its lowest point on initiative count 20 of each round, losing initiative ties, until the trap resets.

Any creature in the room when the ceiling drops must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 55 (`10d10`) bludgeoning damage and has the [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition. On a successful save, the creature can rush from the room, taking no damage, or remain in the room and take half as much damage only. A creature that can fit in spaces as narrow as 6 inches has advantage on the save thanks to the narrow gap that remains between the ceiling and floor when the ceiling is at its lowest level.

A Small or larger creature subjected to the trap can choose to make a DC 20 Strength saving throw instead of a Dexterity saving throw, provided the creature doesn't have the [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition, with the aim of slowing the ceiling's descent for the betterment of others. The creature making the Strength saving throw takes 55 (`10d10`) bludgeoning damage regardless of whether its save succeeds or fails. If the save succeeds, however, the trap's damage to other creatures is reduced to 0 until initiative count 20 of the next round (losing initiative ties).

The ceiling is too heavy to be stopped by any braces, but an [Immovable Rod](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/immovable-rod.md) or similar item can prevent it from dropping so far as to crush anyone.

#### T11: Strange Altar

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A dark, triangular altar stands in the center of this chamber. Carved into each side of the altar is a niche containing a chest. One chest is plated with gold, one is plated with silver, and the last is plated with lead.{ #3b0}


The chests are unlocked, and their contents are as follows:

- **Gold Chest.** This [chest](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/chest.md) is worth 100 gp on its own and contains 100 gp.  
- **Silver Chest.** This [chest](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/chest.md) is worth 50 gp on its own and contains a ceremonial [dagger](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/dagger.md) plated with electrum with an amethyst set in its pommel (worth 750 gp).  
- **Lead Chest.** This worthless [chest](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/chest.md) contains a [Spell Scroll](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll.md) of [Knock](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md), which the altar trap values at 200 gp (see below).  

##### Altar Trap

Removing a chest or its contents from a niche causes the altar's carvings to glow with pale light. Creatures in the room have 1 minute to either return the chest and its contents to the niche or place one or more items of equal or greater value into the niche. Otherwise, one of the following effects occurs when the time expires, depending on the chest involved:

- **Gold Chest.** Six [swarms of poisonous snakes](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-poisonous-snakes.md) teleport into the room. The snakes are hostile.  
- **Silver Chest.** A burst of desiccating energy radiates from the altar in a 15-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (`4d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **Lead Chest.** A [death knight](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/death-knight.md) teleports into the room, appearing in a random unoccupied space within 15 feet of the altar. The knight is hostile.  

#### T12: Room of Respite

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A marble gazebo with a fountain at its center is surrounded by flowering bushes.{ #3b3}


This room is safe.

##### Fountain

The fountain's waters have healing properties. A creature that drinks from the fountain regains 21 (`6d6`) hit points. Once a creature has benefited from the fountain's magic, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

#### T13: Celestial Sky Mirage

A hidden door conceals this room. Creatures that step through the doorway are seemingly transported to a location outdoors, thanks to illusion magic:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You're transported to a grassy field with a starry night sky above you.{ #3b6}


The grassy field and night sky are illusions concealing a bare, rectangular room. Characters can move only as far as the room's walls and ceiling allow, for though these surfaces are hidden to normal eyes, they can be felt. Creatures with [truesight](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Truesight) recognize the illusions as mirages and can see the room as it actually is; they can also see an engraved black box resting on a black dais in the middle of the room. Characters who can't see the box and dais can locate them by touch after a careful search of the area.

##### Observing the Night Sky

A character observing the mirage of the night sky can make a DC 14 Intelligence ([Nature](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check. On a success, a character realizes that, while beautiful, the night sky is wholly inaccurate, as if created by someone who has never seen the sky before. Succeeding on this check also allows the character to see through the room's illusions, revealing not only the walls and ceiling but also the box and the dais on which it sits.

##### Box Trap

The engraved box can't be forced open, but a character can try to unlock it using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful a DC 20 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. A [Knock](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic also unlocks the box.

A character who inspects the box before opening it can make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. On a successful check, the character notices a spring-loaded compartment beneath the box's lid. A character can use thieves' tools to try to dismantle this compartment and disable the trap, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. If the trap isn't deactivated, poisoned darts burst from the box when it's opened. Each creature within 10 feet of the box when the trap is sprung must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (`4d4`) piercing damage and have the [poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for 1 hour.

##### Treasure

Contained within the box is a delicate gold ring engraved with geometric star designs. This ring isn't magical or of any significant monetary value, but Laysa's ancestors once used it in traditional storytelling ceremonies involving astrology. This is one of the treasures Laysa mentioned earlier in this chapter.

#### T14: Juggernaut Arena

![Anyone who wanders into th...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/116-07-005-granite-juggernauts.webp#center "Anyone who wanders into the tomb's arena must contend with granite juggernauts")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Thin, obsidian pillars are spaced throughout this musty room, the ceiling of which is only ten feet high. In the flickering light, you see two massive, rolling constructs roving the space.{ #3bb}


The room's ceiling is 10 feet high—barely large enough to accommodate the two [granite juggernauts](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/granite-juggernaut-veor.md) (see appendix A) that trundle between the room's pillars. The juggernauts attack any intruders they notice, but they won't strike pillars.

The juggernauts fight until they are destroyed or until a creature destroys the triangular stone in the control room (area T15).

#### T15: Juggernaut Control Room

A hidden door conceals this room.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A five-foot-tall, triangular stone covered in runes stands in this bare room's center. At the top of the stone, a plum-sized diamond pulses with red light.{ #3bd}


The triangular stone is immovable and powers the [juggernauts](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/granite-juggernaut-veor.md) in area T14. A character who examines the triangular stone and succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence ([Arcana](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check can decipher its runes and discern its purpose.

##### Destroying the Stone

The triangular stone has AC 20; 100 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage; and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. When the stone is destroyed, the juggernauts in area T14 stop moving and become inanimate objects.

##### Treasure

Once the stone has been destroyed or both juggernauts have been defeated, characters can take the diamond, which is worth 5,000 gp. The diamond stops glowing when it leaves the room.

#### T16: Acid Pit Crossing

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Filling most of this chamber is a ten-foot-deep pit of green acid, over which stretches a three-foot-wide stone bridge. Nozzles embedded in the north and south walls shoot blasts of air across the bridge.{ #3c1}


A creature that falls into the acid takes 21 (`6d6`) acid damage. Any creature that starts its turn in the acid also takes this damage.

##### Gust Nozzles

Air blasts from nozzles in the walls north and south of the bridge with such force that they can't be easily stoppered. When a creature moves onto the bridge for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, or when a flying creature enters a space above the bridge or the acid pit for the first time on a turn, the creature must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed by the gusts 5 feet north or south (determined randomly) and has the [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition; if the space isn't on a surface that can support the creature, the creature falls as normal.

#### T17: Jade Serpent Guardians' Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A jade statue stands between this room's two exits. The statue depicts an armored, feminine figure from the waist up, with six arms and a gleaming curved sword in each hand; from the waist down, the statue's body is serpentine. Two statues depicting large cobras with jade scales sit in alcoves to the east.{ #3c4}


If one or more characters enter the room, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The center statue's eyes glow with white light, and the cobra statues begin writhing toward you.{ #3c5}


The central statue uses the [marilith](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/marilith.md) stat block but is a Construct. This central statue controls the two cobra statues; each cobra statue uses the [spirit naga](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/spirit-naga.md) stat block but is a Construct. The statues speak Common. The statues are hostile toward any creature that enters the chamber.

![Sword of Sharpness (scimit...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/117-07-006-sword-of-sharpness.webp#center "Sword of Sharpness (scimitar) with a snake-shaped pommel")

##### Appeasing the Statues

A character can use an action to try to appease the statues with a DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check; if the character makes an offering of food or treasure worth 50 gp or more, this check is made with advantage. On a successful check, the statues become friendly toward the characters and cease attacking.

The statues served as island guardians for centuries before Acererak abducted them. If informed about Laysa, the statues are thrilled to learn about her efforts.

Acererak's magic confines the statues to this room, but previous adventurers have told them about surrounding areas. The statues can share details about what's in areas T16 and T18.

##### Treasure

One of the central statue's swords functions as a [Sword of Sharpness (scimitar)](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sword-of-sharpness.md) in the hands of a Humanoid. The scimitar is one of the treasures Laysa mentioned earlier in this chapter. If told about Laysa, the central statue willingly gives the sword; otherwise, the sword can be retrieved when all the statues have been defeated.

#### T18: Hall of Discordance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Eight niches are built into these walls. Each niche contains a musical instrument: a lute, a lyre, a viol, a flute, a drum, a dulcimer, a shawm, and a horn. At the end of the hallway is a double door emblazoned with two theater masks—one elated and one despairing.{ #3c9}


When a creature comes within 5 feet of any of the instruments, they all glow with a purple light and begin playing on their own, filling the hall with an awful din. Each creature in the hall must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw, taking 16 (`3d10`) psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. After the damage is dealt, the instruments cease to play or glow, becoming normal items of their kind.

##### Mask Door

Upon closer inspection, the mouths of both masks are open slots, each large enough to fit a Medium or Small Humanoid's arm. The doors are locked.

Thin script engraved above the pair of masks reads as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Pay the toll, in blood or in song."{ #3cb}


There are two ways to open the doors. A character can play one of the hallway's instruments and make a DC 20 Charisma ([Performance](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance)) check; if the character doesn't have proficiency with the chosen instrument, this check is made with disadvantage. On a successful check, the doors open. On a failed check, the character takes 16 (`3d10`) psychic damage, and the doors remain locked.

Alternatively, a character can place one of their arms into a mask's open mouth. When each mouth has an arm in it, the mouths clamp down. If both arms belong to the same character, that character takes 28 (`8d6`) piercing damage; if the arms belong to different characters, each character takes 14 (`4d6`) piercing damage. The mouths then unclamp, and the doors unlock.

#### T19: Library

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Shelves filled with tomes and scrolls line the walls of this expansive chamber. Five stone statues depicting skeletal warriors stand sentinel throughout the room.{ #3cd}


![A Manual of Bodily Healthy...](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/118-07-007-manual-of-bodily-health.webp#center "A Manual of Bodily Healthy written on engraved copper sheets")

##### Guardians

Whenever an item is removed from this room's shelves, one of the five skeletal statues here springs to life. The statue uses the [stone golem](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/stone-golem.md) stat block but is Medium and hostile, attacking whichever creature took the item. The statue remains active until the triggering item is returned or until the statue is destroyed. Multiple statues can be active at once.

##### Treasure

A thorough search of the shelves' contents takes 10 minutes and yields the following items:

- [Spell Scroll](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll.md) of [Greater Restoration](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md)  
- Set of engraved copper sheets that functions as a [Manual of Bodily Health](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/manual-of-bodily-health.md) (one of the treasures Laysa mentioned earlier in this chapter)  
- Thin, leather-bound journal written in Common that explains that the combination for the crypt doors (area T25) is the word "die" in Draconic  

#### T20a–T20b: Void Closets

These two storage closets are identical. The door to each room is locked. As an action, a character can use thieves' tools to try to unlock either door, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. Each door can also be forced open from either side with a successful DC 11 Strength ([Athletics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, or with a [Knock](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room is pitch dark.{ #3d1}


The interior of each closet is filled with magical darkness that can't be dispelled.

##### Spheres of Annihilation

In the center of each room is an uncontrolled [Sphere of Annihilation](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sphere-of-annihilation.md). The magical darkness obscures the sphere; only creatures with [truesight](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Truesight) can detect its presence.

#### T21: Phantasmal Mirage

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Eerie sounds echo in this pitch-dark room.{ #3d4}


This room is filled with magical darkness, and neither the darkness nor the eerie sounds can be dispelled. Any creature that enters this room for the first time must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or have the [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition, as the darkness and eerie sounds conjure up the creature's deepest fears. The [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition ends on the creature when it leaves the room.

While [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) in this way, a creature takes 11 (`2d10`) psychic damage for every 5 feet it moves. After taking this damage, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the frightened condition on a itself on a success.

##### Piercing the Illusion

Creatures with [truesight](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Truesight) see the room for what it is: an abandoned study. A dusty desk and empty bookcase line the east wall.

#### T22: Vortex Bridge

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A dull roar fills this hexagonal chamber. A bridge consisting of engraved, colored limestone tiles stretches between two ledges. A pitch-black vortex of energy churns beneath the bridge.{ #3d7}


The tiled bridge stretches over a gravity vortex 60 feet below. The force of the vortex reduces the flying speed of any creature within the room to 0 feet.

![Map 7.4: Vortex Bridge Puzzle](3-Mechanics/CLI/adventures/vecna-eve-of-ruin/img/119-07-009-vortex-bridge-puzzle.webp#center)

##### Bridge Puzzle

Close inspection of the bridge's tiles reveals that each one bears an engraved symbol representing one of the eight schools of magic. A [See Invisibility](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/see-invisibility.md) spell or similar effect uncovers concealed writing on the ledge before the bridge, which reads as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "The vortex eats all magic, save for that from which it was born."{ #3d9}


To cross the bridge safely, creatures must step on the tiles bearing the symbol for evocation magic, which are red, or the tiles bearing the symbol for transmutation magic, which are orange. The tiles are shown on map 7.4.

When observed within the range of a [Detect Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell or similar magic, the vortex radiates an aura of evocation and transmutation magic. A character who observes the vortex or witnesses the flight-inhibiting effect of the room's gravity well can make a DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check, recalling the following facts on a success:

- The spell [Reverse Gravity](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/reverse-gravity.md) is a transmutation spell.  
- The school of transmutation magic deals with manipulating energy and matter.  
- Evocation spells create powerful elemental effects.  

If the players have trouble with this puzzle, reveal that the characters must step on only evocation or transmutation tiles, and tell them which colors these tiles are. When a creature steps on an incorrect tile, the tile breaks away, and both the tile and the creature are sucked into the vortex below. The creature takes 36 (`8d8`) force damage and is teleported to a safe, unoccupied space at the south end of the room or in the tunnel leading to area T19.

#### T23: Arcane Laboratory

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Three tall, glass cylinders line the back wall of this dimly lit chamber. Each cylinder contains a decaying corpse, half-buried in snow topped with red powder. Against the north wall stands a bare wooden desk.{ #3db}


This chamber bears the remnants of Acererak's endeavors to create empowered simulacra to guard his many tombs. A character who examines the cylinders and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognizes the snow and powdered ruby in each glass cylinder as components for creating a simulacrum.

##### Secret Desk Compartment

A character who searches the desk and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check discovers that one of its drawers contains a locked false bottom. Rerak (see area T26) carries the key to this compartment, but a character with thieves' tools can use them to try to unlock the compartment, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. A [Knock](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic also unlocks the compartment.

The secret compartment bears a magical trap. If the compartment is opened by any means other than using the key found on Rerak in area T26, magical lightning shoots from the drawer. Each creature in the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 26 (`4d12`) lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A [Detect Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell or similar effect unveils the source of this trap: a tiny rune inscribed in the drawer. The trap can be disarmed by dispelling the rune with a [Dispel Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell (DC 17).

##### Treasure

Within the hidden desk compartment is a rose quartz [Crystal Ball](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/crystal-ball.md) and a stack of notes written in Common. The Crystal Ball is one of the treasures Laysa mentioned earlier in this chapter.

A character who spends 10 minutes studying the notes learns about Acererak's endeavors to create empowered simulacra of himself to guard his tombs. Acererak speaks of his simulacra with disdain, viewing them as tools. He finds the fact that his simulacra can develop sentience a sadistic joke.

The notes also explain that the combination for the crypt doors (area T25) is the word "die" in Draconic.

#### T24: Underwater Trench Mirage

Characters standing outside this room can see that it is empty, but a [Detect Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals the presence of illusion magic throughout. When one or more characters enter the room, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls, floor, and ceiling of the chamber vanish, replaced with a dark ocean in which you are submerged. There is no visible surface. Beneath you swims a large, finned shadow.{ #3df}


This chamber contains a mirage of a deep, underwater trench. Though illusory, the seawater is tactile, and creatures unable to breathe underwater suffocate while in this chamber.

A hostile [giant shark](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-shark.md) swims beneath the characters. The shark is part of the mirage, though it can harm characters who don't pierce the illusion. The shark can't harm anyone outside the room.

##### Piercing the Illusion

A creature that succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check can see through the illusion, perceiving the empty room and its exits. A creature with [truesight](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Truesight) can also see through the illusion.

Upon realizing the illusion, a creature can breathe the water as easily as it breathes air. However, the creature continues to interact with the water as if it were tactile, such as swimming through it.

#### T25: Crypt Doors

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This corridor ends at a massive double door with a carved relief depicting a river of screaming souls flowing through a ravaged landscape. Instead of handles, the doors bear a trio of concentric, rune-carved platinum circles that can be rotated. At the circles' center is an engraving of a leering skull.{ #3e2}


The platinum circles are the locking mechanisms for the crypt doors. A character who can read Draconic sees the letters *a* through *z* in Draconic on each circle.

When the three concentric rings are aligned so they spell the word "die" in Draconic, the crypt doors unlock. This combination can be found in areas T19 and T23. Alternatively, a character using thieves' tools can spend 1 minute trying to unlock the doors, doing so with a successful DC 25 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. A [Knock](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic also unlocks the doors.

##### Knockout-Gas Trap

If the double door is opened via any other means besides the correct combination, a cloud of sweet-smelling gas is released from the skull engraving. The gas fills the widened area immediately south of the double door. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or have the [unconscious](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) condition for `2d4 + 10` minutes. An [unconscious](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) creature can repeat this saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

#### T26: Crypt

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Six stone pedestals stand near the walls of this expansive room. From left to right, they bear a blue scarf, a golden ring, a glittering scimitar, an ebony wand wrapped with feathers and bone, a set of engraved copper sheets, and a crystal ball made of rose quartz.
> 
> At the room's center looms a black throne, upon which sits a skeleton dressed in luxurious robes and headdress. A platinum door stands behind the throne.{ #3e5}


The figure sitting on the throne is Rerak, a [false lich](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/false-lich-veor.md) (see appendix A). Although alert, Rerak remains motionless until he takes damage or a creature moves within 15 feet of him, at which point he becomes hostile and attacks.

##### Appeasing Rerak

Upon creation, Rerak was magically bound to Acererak's piece of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md); as long as the rod piece remains within the tomb, so must Rerak. Rerak resents his creator for leaving him to languish within this tomb, and though he remains loyal to Acererak, he longs to experience the world beyond the tomb's walls.

Throughout the fight, Rerak commands the characters to flee. Each time Rerak does this, each character can make a DC 19 Wisdom ([Insight](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check without taking an action. On a successful check, the character discerns a melancholy tone to Rerak's words, as if he loathed that he must kill them.

During combat, a character can use an action to try to convince Rerak to turn against his creator. Have that character make a DC 23 Charisma ([Persuasion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If the character mentions the mirages or Acererak's disdain toward his creations (found in the notes in area T23), this check is made with advantage. On a successful check, Rerak's loyalty to Acererak is shaken. After three successful checks, Rerak halts the battle and crushes his eye sockets' gems, severing his connection to Acererak and releasing any souls trapped within.

##### Rerak's Secret

If the characters convince Rerak to turn against Acererak and talk with the false lich about his imprisonment in the tomb or his mistreatment at the archlich's hands, Rerak reveals how unhappy and lonely he has been for centuries. Rerak also reveals that as far back as his earliest memory, the false lich never truly wanted to fulfill Acererak's will.

Regardless of the characters' reaction to this revelation, learning it counts as a secret for the purposes of the Power of Secrets rules in this book's introduction.

##### False Treasures

The items on the pedestals are false re-creations of treasures that can be found throughout the complex. A creature that touches one of these false treasures must immediately succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage and have the [stunned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) condition until the start of its next turn.

##### Keys

Rerak carries two keys: a platinum key shaped like a skeleton that unlocks the door to the crypt's vault (area T27) and a plain iron key that unlocks the secret compartment in area T23. Characters who defeat Rerak find the keys amid his dusty remains.

If the characters convinced Rerak to turn against his creator, Rerak provides the keys willingly.

#### T27: Crypt Vault

The door to the crypt vault is locked and protected by magical wards. It can be unlocked only with the platinum skeleton key in Rerak's possession. A creature that attempts to open the vault by any other means must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (`8d6`) force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The [sixth piece](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) of the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md) rests on the pedestal.

For more about the [Rod of Seven Parts](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/rod-of-seven-parts-veor.md), see this book's introduction.

##### Treasure

If a character shows the silk sash to Laysa, she identifies it as a garment given to her people that functions as a [Robe of Stars](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/robe-of-stars.md). The robe is one of the treasures Laysa mentioned earlier in this chapter.

The mundane treasure within the vault includes the following:

- 479 sp, 342 gp, and 179 pp  
- Jade game board with platinum playing pieces, worth 7,500 gp in total  
- Set of ruby earrings worth 500 gp  
- Three fire opals worth 1,000 gp each  

##### Exit

The door in the middle of the north wall is locked and can be unlocked only by using Rerak's platinum skeleton key. The door opens into a cave tunnel that leads to the beach, about 1 mile south of the archaeologists' camp.

## Next Steps

Once they've left the Tomb of Wayward Souls, the characters can return to the archaeologists' camp without incident. Laysa celebrates the characters' safe return; if the characters brought back any of the ancestral treasures she's been searching for, Laysa pays them as promised.

If Rerak is with the party, he volunteers to lend his knowledge of the tomb to help the archaeologists in their excavation. The archaeologists are apprehensive but nonetheless accept his aid.

While Rerak aids the archaeologists, he doesn't hurt them. Rerak won't return to Sigil with the characters; the simulacrum worries that the magic that sustains him might extinguish if he leaves Oerth. Rerak hopes to make a home on the Isle of Serpents with anyone who welcomes him.

The characters can return to Sigil through the doorway near the lagoon at their leisure.
