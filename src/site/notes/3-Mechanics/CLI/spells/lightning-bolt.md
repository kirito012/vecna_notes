# Lightning Bolt
*3rd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (100-foot Line)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `8d6` lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 3rd.
