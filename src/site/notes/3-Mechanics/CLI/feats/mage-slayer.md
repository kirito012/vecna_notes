*Source: Player's Handbook p. 168*  
You have practiced techniques useful in melee combat against spellcasters, gaining the following benefits:

- When a creature within 5 feet of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.  
- When you damage a creature that is [concentrating](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on a spell, that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw it makes to maintain its [concentration](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration).  
- You have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by creatures within 5 feet of you.
