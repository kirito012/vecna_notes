**Prerequisite**: 19th
**Ability Score Increase**: Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 30.
You gain the following benefits.

## Improve Fate

When you or another creature within 60 feet of you succeeds on or fails a [D20 Test](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md), you can roll `2d4` and apply the total rolled as a bonus or penalty to the `d20` roll. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you roll Initiative or finish a Short or Long Rest.
