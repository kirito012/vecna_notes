# Mounted Combatant
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 168*  
You are a dangerous foe to face while "mounted". While you are mounted and aren't [incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount.  
- You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead.  
- If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
