# Actor
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 202*  
**Prerequisite**: 4th; Charisma 13 or higher
**Ability Score Increase**: Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
You gain the following benefits.

## Impersonation

While you're disguised as a real or fictional person, you have Advantage on Charisma ([Deception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Performance](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance)) checks to convince others that you are that person.

## Mimicry

You can mimic the sounds of other creatures, including speech. A creature that hears the mimicry must succeed on a Wisdom ([Insight](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check to determine the effect is faked (DC 8 plus your Charisma modifier and Proficiency Bonus).
