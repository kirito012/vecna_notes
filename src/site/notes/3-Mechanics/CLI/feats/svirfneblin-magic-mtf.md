# Svirfneblin Magic
*Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 114, Elemental Evil Player's Companion p. 7, Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide p. 115*  
**Prerequisite**: gnome (deep)
You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors. This ability allows you to cast [nondetection](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/nondetection.md) on yourself at will, without needing a material component. You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: [blindness/deafness](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/blindness-deafness.md), [blur](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/blur.md), and [disguise self](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md). You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you cast them at their lowest possible levels.
