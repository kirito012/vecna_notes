# Dragon Fear
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 74*  
**Prerequisite**: [Dragonborn](3-Mechanics/CLI/races/dragonborn.md)
**Ability Score Increase**: Increase your Strength, Constitution, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.
When angered, you radiate menace. You gain the following benefits:

- Instead of exhaling destructive energy, you can expend a use of your Breath Weapon trait to roar, forcing each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). A target automatically succeeds on the save if it can't hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of you for 1 minute. If the [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
