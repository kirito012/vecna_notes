# Eldritch Adept
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 79*  
**Prerequisite**: Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature
Studying occult lore, you learn one [Eldritch Invocation](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-optfeaturetype-ei.md) option of your choice from the warlock class. Your spellcasting ability for the invocation is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat). If the invocation has a prerequisite of any kind, you can choose that invocation only if you're a warlock who meets the prerequisite.

Whenever you gain a level, you can replace the invocation with another one from the warlock class.
