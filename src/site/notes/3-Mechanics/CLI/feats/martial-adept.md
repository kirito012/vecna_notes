# Martial Adept
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 168*  
You have martial training that allows you to perform special combat maneuvers. You gain the following benefits:

- You learn two [maneuvers](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-optfeaturetype-mv-b.md) of your choice from among those available to the [Battle Master](3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/fighter-battle-master.md) archetype in the fighter class. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).  
- You gain one superiority die, which is a `d6` (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
