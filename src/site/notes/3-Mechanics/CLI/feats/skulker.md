# Skulker
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 170*  
**Prerequisite**: Dexterity 13 or higher
You are expert at slinking through shadows. You gain the following benefits:

- You can try to hide when you are lightly obscured from the creature from which you are hiding.  
- When you are hidden from a creature and miss it with a ranged weapon attack, making the attack doesn't reveal your position.  
- Dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom ([Perception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks relying on sight.
