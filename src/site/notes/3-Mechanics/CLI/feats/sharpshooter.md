# Sharpshooter
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 170*  
You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:

- Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.  
- Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.  
- Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.
