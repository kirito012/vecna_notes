# Wood Elf Magic
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 75*  
**Prerequisite**: [Elf (Wood)](3-Mechanics/CLI/races/elf-wood.md)
You learn the magic of the primeval woods, which are revered and protected by your people. You learn one druid cantrip of your choice. You also learn the [longstrider](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/longstrider.md) and [pass without trace](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/pass-without-trace.md) spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
