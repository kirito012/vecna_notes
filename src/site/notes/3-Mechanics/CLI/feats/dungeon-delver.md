# Dungeon Delver
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 166*  
Alert to the hidden traps and secret doors found in many dungeons, you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) and Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) checks made to detect the presence of secret doors.  
- You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist traps.  
- You have resistance to the damage dealt by traps.  
- Traveling at a fast pace doesn't impose the normal -5 penalty on your passive Wisdom ([Perception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score.
