# Fade Away
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 74*  
**Prerequisite**: [Gnome](3-Mechanics/CLI/races/gnome.md)
**Ability Score Increase**: Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence by 1, to a maximum of 20.
Your people are clever, with a knack for illusion magic. You have learned a magical trick for fading away when you suffer harm. You gain the following benefits:

- Immediately after you take damage, you can use a reaction to magically become [invisible](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force someone to make a saving throw. Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
