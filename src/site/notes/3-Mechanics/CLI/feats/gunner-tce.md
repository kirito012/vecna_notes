**Ability Score Increase**: Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
You have a quick hand and keen eye when employing firearms, granting you the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency with firearms (see "[Firearms](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/firearms.md)" in the Dungeon Master's Guide).  
- You ignore the loading property of firearms.  
- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.
