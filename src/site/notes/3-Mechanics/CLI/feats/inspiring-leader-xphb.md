**Prerequisite**: 4th; Wisdom 13 or higher or 4th; Charisma 13 or higher
**Ability Score Increase**: Increase your Wisdom or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.
You gain the following benefits.

## Bolstering Performance

When you finish a Short or Long Rest, you can give an inspiring performance: a speech, song, or dance.

The chosen creatures each gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your character level plus the modifier of the ability you increased with this feat.
