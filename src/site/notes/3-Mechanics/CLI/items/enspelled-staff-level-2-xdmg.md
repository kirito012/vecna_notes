Bound into this staff is a level 2 spell. The spell is determined when the staff is created and can be of any school of magic. The staff has 6 charges and regains `1d6` expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 charge to cast its spell. If you expend the staff 's last charge, roll `d20`. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical [Quarterstaff](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/quarterstaff-xphb.md).

The spell's saving throw DC is 13, and its attack bonus is `+5`.
