# Arrow of Slaying
*Ammunition, minor, very rare*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/arrow-of-slaying.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 0.05 lbs.

an arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both *arrows of dragon slaying* and *arrows of blue dragon slaying*. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra `6d10` piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.
