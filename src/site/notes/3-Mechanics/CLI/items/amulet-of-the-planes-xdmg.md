# Amulet of the Planes
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/amulet-of-the-planes.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

While wearing this amulet, you can take a [Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. On a successful check, you cast [Plane Shift](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift-xphb.md). On a failed check, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination determined by rolling `1d100` and consulting the following table.

`dice: [](amulet-of-the-planes-xdmg.md#^1-destination)`
