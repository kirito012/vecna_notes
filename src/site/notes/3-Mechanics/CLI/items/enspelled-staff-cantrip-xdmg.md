# Enspelled Staff (Cantrip)
*Staff, weapon, uncommon (requires attunement by a Spellcaster)*  


- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [Versatile](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

Bound into this staff is a cantrip. The cantrip is determined when the staff is created and can be of any school of magic. The staff has 6 charges and regains `1d6` expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 charge to cast its spell. If you expend the staff 's last charge, roll `d20`. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical [Quarterstaff](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/quarterstaff-xphb.md).

The spell's saving throw DC is 13, and its attack bonus is `+5`.
