# Cauldron of Rebirth
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a druid or warlock)*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/cauldron-of-rebirth.webp#right)


This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast-iron sides.

You can use the cauldron as a [Spellcasting Focus](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/spellcasting-focus-xphb.md) for your spells, and it functions as a suitable component for the [Scrying](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scrying-xphb.md) spell.

## Brew Potion

When you finish a [Long Rest](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md), you can use the cauldron to create a [Potion of Healing (greater)](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-greater-healing-xdmg.md), which takes 1 minute. The potion lasts for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed.

## Raise Dead

As a [Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action, you can cause the cauldron to grow large enough for a Medium creature to crouch within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal size as a [Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action, harmlessly shunting anything that can't fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.

If you place the corpse of a Humanoid into the cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of salt (which costs 10 GP) for at least 8 hours, the salt is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by [Raise Dead](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/raise-dead-xphb.md) at the next dawn. Once used, this property can't be used again for 7 days.
