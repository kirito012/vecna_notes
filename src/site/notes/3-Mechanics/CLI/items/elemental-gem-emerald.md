# Elemental Gem, Emerald
*Wondrous item, minor, uncommon*  



This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, a [water elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) is summoned as if you had cast the [conjure elemental](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental.md) spell, and the gem's magic is lost.
