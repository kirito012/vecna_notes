# Alchemy Jug
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/alchemy-jug.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 12.0 lbs.

This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. The jug sloshes when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.

You can take a [Magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action and name one liquid from the Alchemy Jug Liquids table to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as a [Utilize](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Utilize) action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named.

Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.
