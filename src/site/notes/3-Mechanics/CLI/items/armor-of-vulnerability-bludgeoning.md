# Armor of Vulnerability (Bludgeoning)
*Heavy armor ([plate armor](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/plate-armor.md)), cursed item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  


- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Properties**: [Cursed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning damage.

## Curse

This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an [identify](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/identify.md) spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the [remove curse](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed you have vulnerability to piercing and slashing damage.
