# [Noble Prodigy](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/noble-prodigy-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 227*  

Noble prodigies trace their lineage to a legendary hero, a demigod, a dragon, or some other ancestor that grants them magical prowess. Among some nobles, the source of a prodigy's magic might be a family secret.

## Nobles

*Royals and Rich Folk*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Individual  

Nobles encompass a variety of people with social influence. They might be rulers, wealthy merchants, callous bureaucrats, or the idle elite.
