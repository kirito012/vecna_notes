# [Priest](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/priest-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 248*  

Priests draw on their beliefs to heal the needful and smite their foes. They can channel their faith as spells and empower their weapons with divine might.

## Priests

*Arbiters of the Mortal and the Divine*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Individual, Relics  

Priests harness the power of faith to work miracles. These religious adherents are as diverse as the faiths they follow. Some obey gods and their servants, while others live by age-old creeds. Belief guides priests' actions and their magic, which they use to shape the world in line with their ideologies.

Roll on or choose a result from the Priest Roles table to inspire different sorts of priests.
