# [Bandit Captain](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/bandit-captain-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 27*  

Bandit captains command gangs of scoundrels and conduct straightforward heists. Others serve as guards and muscle for more influential criminals.

## Bandits

*Criminals and Scoundrels*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Bandits use the threat of violence to take what they want. Such criminals include gang members, desperadoes, and lawless mercenaries. Yet not all bandits are motivated by greed. Some are driven to lives of crime by unjust laws, desperation, or the threats of merciless leaders.

Roll on or choose a result from the Bandit Motivations table to determine the circumstances behind a bandit's crimes.
