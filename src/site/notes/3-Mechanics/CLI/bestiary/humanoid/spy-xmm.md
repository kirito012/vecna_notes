# [Spy](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/spy-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 295*  

Spies use charm and deception to veil their true intentions. If forced into combat, they seek to end such conflicts quietly and decisively.

## Spies

*Infiltrators and Informants*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Implements, Individual  

Spies gather information and disseminate lies, manipulating people to gain the results the spies' patrons desire. They're trained to manipulate, infiltrate, and—when necessary—escape in a hurry. Many adopt disguises, aliases, or code names to maintain anonymity. Roll on or choose a result from the Spy Personas table to inspire a spy's disguise.
