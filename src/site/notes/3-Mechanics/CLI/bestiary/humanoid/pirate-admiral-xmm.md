# [Pirate Admiral](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/pirate-admiral-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 242*  

Pirate admirals command whole pirate fleets. They undertake audacious ventures, such as challenging the navies of coastal nations, hunting legendary sea creatures, or carving out their own pirate kingdoms. Pirate admirals might launch their fleets from hidden fortresses where they hoard their treasureâ€”or keep maps to where they've hidden their riches. Some pirate admirals ally with the followers of oceanic deities, underwater dwellers, and sea monsters, as well as their fellow scalawags.

## Pirates

*Freebooters and Fortune Hunters*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Individual, Implements  

The term "pirate" encompasses a broad range of seafarers, including vicious sea rovers, dogged privateers, cursed treasure hunters, and others who seek riches and fame on the seas.

Pirates might be allies, foes, wild cards, or some combination thereof. While they are the bane of merchants and coastal communities, they know secrets of the sea and how to avoid aquatic threats. More unusual pirates set their sights beyond the waves, using airships, spelljamming vessels, plane-shifting craft, or stranger vehicles to explore and raid incredible realms.

### Pirate Flags

To terrify opponents and spread their reputations, pirate crews fly distinctive flags. Roll twice on or choose results from the Pirate Flags table to inspire what flag a pirate crew sails under.
