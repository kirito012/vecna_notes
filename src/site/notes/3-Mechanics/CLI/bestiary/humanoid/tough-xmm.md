# [Tough](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/tough-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 307. Available in the Free Rules (2024)*  

Toughs might work in groups at the direction of a leader, or individual toughs might bully weaker folk into doing what they say.

## Toughs

*Brawlers and Bullies*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Armaments  

Bodyguards, belligerents, and laborers, toughs rely on their physical strength to intimidate foes. They might be brawny criminals, rowdy tavern goers, seasoned workers, or anyone who uses their muscle to get what they want.
