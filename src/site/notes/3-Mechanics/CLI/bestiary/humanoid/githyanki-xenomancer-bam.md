# [Githyanki Xenomancer](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/githyanki-xenomancer-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 27, Light of Xaryxis*  

A githyanki xenomancer travels to the farthest reaches of Wildspace and the Astral Sea, even visiting worlds of the Material Plane from time to time, to study and catalog creatures it has never encountered before. Friendly contact with sapient creatures can bring the xenomancer's diplomatic skills to the forefront, while hostile contact becomes a test of the xenomancer's survival skills.

Sometimes a xenomancer's research requires that a specimen be captured and imprisoned (to study its behavior) or killed and dissected (to study or harvest its insides). Many xenomancers prefer to do this work in their laboratories on the Astral Plane.
