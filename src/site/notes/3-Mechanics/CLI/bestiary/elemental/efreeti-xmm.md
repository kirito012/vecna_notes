## Efreeti

*Genie of Fire*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Planar (Elemental Plane of Fire)  
- **Treasure.** Armaments  

Efreet burn with the energy and unpredictability of fire. Their innate magic allows them to conjure flames from nothing and shape treasures within magical infernos. Many efreet have wicked reputations, as their fickle natures and love for dramatic conflagrations can be destructive. Other efreet delight in fire's beauty, be it the delicacy of a candle flame or the shared wonder of fireworks. These genies might aid mortals in exchange for treasures or the liberation of captive Elementals.

On many worlds, efreet dwell in sweltering deserts and volcanic regions. Those that make their homes on the Elemental Plane of Fire create incredible cities among seas of flame and molten minerals. Eclipsing all of these is the storied City of Brass, a gleaming metropolis that is one of the most wondrous cities in the multiverse. Here, magic tempers the plane's extreme heat, making the City of Brass a hub of trade between planes of existence.
