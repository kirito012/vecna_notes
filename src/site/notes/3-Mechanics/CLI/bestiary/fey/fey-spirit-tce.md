    \ the end of this turn.  \n- Mirthful. The fey can force one creature it can\
    \ see within 10 feet of it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save\
    \ DC. Unless the save succeeds, the target is [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ by you and the fey for 1 minute or until the target takes any damage.  \n- Tricksy.\
    \ The fey can fill a 5-foot cube within 5 feet of it with magical darkness, which\
