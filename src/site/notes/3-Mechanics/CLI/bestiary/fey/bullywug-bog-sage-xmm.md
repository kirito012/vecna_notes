# [Bullywug Bog Sage](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\fey/bullywug-bog-sage-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 64. Available in the Free Rules (2024)*  

Bullywug bog sages channel the magic of the swamp to sicken foes and speak with plants.

## Bullywugs

*Amphibious Appreciators of Marsh and Muck*

- **Habitat.** Swamp  
- **Treasure.** Implements, Individual  

Fey embodiments of swamplands, bullywugs protect the murky wilds and consider themselves cosmically favored for that role. These human-size, toad- or frog-like creatures have close relationships with the creatures of the swamp.
