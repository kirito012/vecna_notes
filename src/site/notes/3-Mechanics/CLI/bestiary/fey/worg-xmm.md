# [Worg](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\fey/worg-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 335. Available in the Free Rules (2024)*  

Packs of worgs roam harsh frontiers and cursed lands. They sometimes conspire with goblinoids and gnolls and might serve them as mounts.

## Worgs

*Malicious Lupine Ravagers*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Grassland, Hill, Planar (Feywild)  
- **Treasure.** None  

Sometimes mistaken at first for giant wolves, worgs are vicious hunters. These sapient predators can speak and often taunt their prey, enjoying the taste of fear in their meals.
