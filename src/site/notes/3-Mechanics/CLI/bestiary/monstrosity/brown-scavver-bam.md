# [Brown Scavver](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/brown-scavver-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 49, Light of Xaryxis*  

Brown scavvers are 10 feet long and range in color from sun-dappled brownish gold to dark umber. It takes them days to digest a meal, during which time they attack only in self-defense.

A brown scavver likes to swallow its prey whole. The creature's stomach is filled with poisonous gas, which kills off anything that survives being swallowed.

    \ The scavver can have one creature swallowed at a time.\n\nA swallowed creature\

    \ has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the scavver, and takes\
    \ 13 (3d8) poison damage at the start of each of the scavver's turns from the\
    \ poisonous gas in the scavver's gullet.\n\nIf the scavver takes 15 damage or\
    \ more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the scavver must succeed on\
    \ a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the\
    \ swallowed creature, which falls [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)\
    \ in a space within 10 feet of the scavver. If the scavver dies, a swallowed creature\
    \ is no longer [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by\
    \ it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
