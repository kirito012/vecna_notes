# [Borthak](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/borthak-veor.md)
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 212*  

Borthaks are irascible, wolflike behemoths that ravage northern wetlands and alpine fens on Krynn. Few mountain animals can challenge a borthak physically. Its powerful jaws, acidic spittle, and lightning-quick tail make the borthak an apex predator in its home territory.

Luckily for most wetland dwellers, borthaks rarely congregate. Unluckily, a single borthak can wreak havoc on an entire ecosystem with its supernatural ability to siphon heat from the ground. A borthak's body is so efficient at pulling the heat from its surroundings that it can transform a small, temperate glen into a frigid, slushy bog. Native plants and animals rarely survive long in a region a borthak claims as its hunting ground. Once a borthak has depleted an area of flora and fauna, it moves and begins its pillaging anew.
