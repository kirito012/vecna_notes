## Wereboar

*Changed by the Hunger of the Boar*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Grassland, Hill  
- **Treasure.** Individual  

Wereboars shape-shift from their humanoid forms into powerful boars or humanoid-boar hybrids. Many wereboars suffer their shape-shifting nature as a curse, with some involuntarily transforming any time they perform a greedy act or indulge their selfish nature.
