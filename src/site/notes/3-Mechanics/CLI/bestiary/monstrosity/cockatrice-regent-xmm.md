# [Cockatrice Regent](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/cockatrice-regent-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 75*  

Bolder than their smaller cousins, cockatrice regents brim with unstable magical energy they use to restrain distant foes.

## Cockatrices

*Accursed Avians with the Power to Petrify*

- **Habitat.** Grassland  
- **Treasure.** None  

Cockatrices combine the features of irate roosters and starving reptiles. They petrify those they bite, their slightest peck turning their prey to stone.
