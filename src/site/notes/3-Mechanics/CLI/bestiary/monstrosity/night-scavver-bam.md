# [Night Scavver](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/night-scavver-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 49, Vecna: Eve of Ruin*  

Night scavvers are 15 feet long. Their coloration resembles that of Wildspace itself: white spots (representing stars) sprinkled amid dark patches and patterns of color. They fearlessly invade the air envelopes of spelljamming ships and attack crew members on deck.

Cooked night scavver meat is a popular offering in taverns across Wildspace.
