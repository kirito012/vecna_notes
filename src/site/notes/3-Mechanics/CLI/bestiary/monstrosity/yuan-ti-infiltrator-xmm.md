# [Yuan-ti Infiltrator](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/yuan-ti-infiltrator-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 342*  

Infiltrators can pass as human, their serpentine features limited to scaly skin, forked tongues, and other minor or internal transformations. These spies insinuate themselves among their rivals, manipulating others and making foes vulnerable to the plots of more powerful yuan-ti.

## Yuan-ti

*Power-Hungry Serpentine Conspirators*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Forest, Swamp, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Relics  

Exploiting pacts with sinister supernatural forces, yuan-ti bargain away their humanity for the lethality and predatory deviousness of serpents. From hidden bastions, they manipulate rulers and the wealthy, seeking to control the world. Many yuan-ti possess venomous magic, which often manifests as fangs or striking serpents.

Yuan-ti have humanlike forms with a variety of horrifying serpentine transformations. Some have a scattering of reptilian scales, while others are giants that are more snake than human. Typically, the more snakelike yuan-ti are, the greater esteem they hold among their kind.

Yuan-ti might gain their reptilian features through dangerous supernatural rites. Roll on or choose a result from the Yuan-ti Transformations table to inspire how yuan-ti obtain their serpentine aspects.
