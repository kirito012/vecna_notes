# [Neogi Pirate](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\aberration/neogi-pirate-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 41, Light of Xaryxis*  

Neogi pirates are adult neogi that serve as crew members aboard nightspiders (see the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*) and other neogi-controlled vessels.

Neogi society makes no distinction between individuals, aside from the ability that a given creature has to control others, and they don't comprehend the emotional aspects of existence that humans and similar beings experience. To a neogi, hatred is as foreign a sensation as love, and showing loyalty in the absence of authority is foolishness.

Neogi pirates (and adult neogi in general) mark themselves and those they capture through the use of dyes, transformational magic, and other markings intended to signify rank, achievements, and the identity of the individual's leader. By these signs, neogi can identify each other's place in the hierarchyâ€”and they must defer to those of higher station or risk harsh punishment.
