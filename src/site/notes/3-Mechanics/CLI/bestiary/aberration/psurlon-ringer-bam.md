# [Psurlon Ringer](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\aberration/psurlon-ringer-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 45, Light of Xaryxis*  

A psurlon can use magic to assume the form of a specific Medium Humanoid. First, the psurlon must consume the creature it wants to imitate. It then enters a psionic trance for 8 hours, at the end of which it takes on the appearance of the creature it ate. The psurlon gains that creature's memories and languages, but none of its class features or other abilities. The transformation is permanent and can be undone only by a wish spell. Despite appearances, the psurlon ringer is still an Aberration, and other psurlons recognize it for what it is.
