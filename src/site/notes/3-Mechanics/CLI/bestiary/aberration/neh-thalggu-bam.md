# [Neh-thalggu](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\aberration/neh-thalggu-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 39, Light of Xaryxis*  

Known throughout the multiverse as brain collectors, neh-thalggu consume the brains of Humanoids and use them as receptacles to enhance their magical abilities.

Neh-thalggu are born in the nightmarish Far Realm, but they spread across the Astral Plane and find their way onto the various worlds of the Material Plane, where brains are much more abundant. A neh-thalggu has a bulbous body and six legs resembling those of a crustacean. Four bulging eyes and a tooth-filled maw dominate its hideous visage. Behind and above these features, one or more lumps protrude from its body, each one containing a brain the neh-thalggu has consumed.

After a neh-thalggu kills a victim, it uses its pincers to cut open the victim's head and remove the brain. It then swallows the brain whole. The collected brain is stored inside one of several pockets in the neh-thalggu's head. Once it has collected twelve brains in this fashion, it is overcome by an urge to return to the Far Realm and begins devoting all its energy to finding a way home.

In an encounter with a neh-thalggu, roll a `d12` to determine how many brains it has already collected.
