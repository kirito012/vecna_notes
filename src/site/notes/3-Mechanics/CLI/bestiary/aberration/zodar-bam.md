# [Zodar](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\aberration/zodar-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 64, Light of Xaryxis*  

A zodar is a bipedal entity whose body is encased in an obsidian exoskeleton. It has no facial features aside from two narrow, vertical slits that resemble eyes, and its countenance betrays no hint of pain or emotion. Underneath its armored exterior, a zodar's body is composed of tightly knit muscle fibers that make it incredibly strong and heavy. A zodar weighs 1,500 pounds.

No one knows how many zodars exist or where they came from, but the most popular hypothesis is that they are the creations of some long-forgotten god. Zodars interact with other sapient creatures in a manner that goes beyond mere aloofness. They simply hover in silence. When a zodar finally performs some significant action, the reasons for that action aren't always clear.

One interpretation of this behavior posits that each zodar has a specific mission and is relentless in its pursuit of the goal, but it reacts oddly to situations that don't involve its mission because it doesn't know what else to do. Another theory is that all zodars are working in concert to achieve some master objective. A third, less ominous idea is that zodars lost their sense of purpose when their creator vanished, and they are struggling to find their new role.

A zodar can cause speech to issue from the air around it on three occasions in its lifetime. When it feels compelled to speak, it chooses its words wisely. It can also warp the fabric of the multiverse to cast the wish spell as its final act—it is destroyed once the spell is cast.
