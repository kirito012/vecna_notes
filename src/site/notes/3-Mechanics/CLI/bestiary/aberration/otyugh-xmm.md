## Otyugh

*Garbage-Heap Gourmand*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Otyughs live to eat—the more disgusting the meal, the better. They consider all non-otyughs that come within reach dishes in life's endless buffet. In dumps, sewers, polluted ruins, and similar murky depths, otyughs devour garbage, carcasses, and anything else their tentacles can cram in their expansive maws. Some creatures ply otyughs with trash to recruit them as watchful—if disgusting—guardians.

Otyughs often bury themselves amid trash heaps and observe their surroundings with their eye-studded stalk. They use glittery trash and telepathic urgings to coax creatures close, then burst from hiding, attacking with their spiny tentacles and filthy maws. Roll on or choose a result from the Otyugh Lures table to inspire how an otyugh tempts prey close.
