# [Starlight Apparition](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\celestial/starlight-apparition-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 59, Light of Xaryxis*  

The transparent projections of unfortunate souls who perished in Wildspace or in the Astral Sea are known as starlight apparitions. Each one has a luminous, incorporeal appearance that resembles its former self, but with eyes that glow.

A starlight apparition is different from a ghost. While a ghost is doomed to haunt the place where it died until some promise or goal it couldn't achieve in life is fulfilled, the goal of a starlight apparition is to help someone else avoid or overcome a perilous obstacle or accomplish a difficult task. A starlight apparition comes into being when the soul of a deceased individual, from its resting place in the afterlife, projects a spectral copy of itself across a vast distance with the help of a deity or another powerful celestial entity. The apparition lasts only as long as its services are needed to complete the task at hand; then it fades away, never to return.

    \ leaves the Astral Plane, or the apparition is forced out by an effect like the\
    \ [dispel evil and good](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good-xphb.md)\
    \ spell. When the possession ends, the apparition reappears in an unoccupied space\
    \ within 5 feet of the body. If it reappears in a location not on the Astral Plane,\
    \ the apparition is destroyed. The target is immune to this apparition's Possession\
    \ for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends."
