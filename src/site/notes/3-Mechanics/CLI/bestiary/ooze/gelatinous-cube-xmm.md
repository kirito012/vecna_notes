## Gelatinous Cube

*Dungeon-Scouring Block of Ooze*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Quivering masses of acidic goo, gelatinous cubes wobble through narrow caverns and dungeons, engulfing anything in their paths. These Oozes are naturally transparent, making them difficult to see while they're stationary. Creatures and objects that become stuck within these slimes are gradually dissolved. Undigested detritus sometimes floats within a gelatinous cube, hinting at its past meals. Roll on or choose a result from the Gelatinous Cube Debris table to inspire a gelatinous cube's contents.

    \ can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics))\

    \ space. Success: Half damage, and the target moves to an unoccupied space within\
