# [Vampirate Captain](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\undead/vampirate-captain-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 63, Light of Xaryxis*  

How a crew of vampirates conducts itself depends entirely on the mood and disposition of the captain. The crew of one ship might behave like a murderous mob, while another might abide by an ancient code of chivalry. One captain might allow the crew of a plundered ship to live, while another might leave only flotsam and jetsam in the pirates' wake.

The captain is often accompanied by an undying companion, such as a crawling claw or a will-o'-wisp.
