# [Warhorse Skeleton](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\undead/warhorse-skeleton-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 282*  

Warhorse skeletons are obedient, supernatural steeds bearing the rotted remains of the barding they wore in life. They're often ridden by the corpses of their former riders.

## Skeletons

*Ossified Evil*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Shadowfell), Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** None  

Skeletons rise at the summons of necromancers and foul spirits. Whether they're the remains of the ancient dead or fresh bones bound to morbid ambitions, they commit deathless work for whatever forces reanimated them, often serving as guardians, soldiers, or laborers. In rare cases, skeletons are reanimated but given no particular direction. Roll on or choose a result from the Skeleton Pantomimes table to inspire how undirected skeletons behave.

**Skeleton Pantomimes**
