# [Ancient Brass Dragon](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\dragon/ancient-brass-dragon-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 56*  

Ancient brass dragons create worlds-spanning networks. They combat forces of repression and misinformation, helping people learn from the mistakes of the past. Either personally or through webs of messengers, ancient brass dragons keep allies informed about challenges they can face together.

## Brass Dragons

*Dragons of Lore and Rapport*

- **Habitat.** Desert  
- **Treasure.** Arcana  

Gregarious and outgoing, brass dragons relish sharing knowledge and stories. Although these metallic dragons favor arid lands, they cheerfully journey considerable distances to visit friendly creatures, pass on what they've learned, and collect news. Though good natured, brass dragons don't shirk from combat when necessary, thwarting foes with magical sleep and searing them with flame.

Brass dragons favor warm climes, particularly steppes and rocky or sandy deserts, and they usually dwell near prominent crossroads or oases that regularly draw visitors. They enjoy adopting Humanoid forms, disguising themselves as traveling merchants, scholars, storytellers, or anyone else invested in others' stories.

Brass dragons collect eclectic objects. While such items might seem like knickknacks, each is part of a storyâ€”perhaps a nostalgic memento or evidence of a tale passed into myth. An old friend's hat and the crown of the last ruler of a forgotten dynasty could occupy the same shelf in a brass dragon's hoard.

### Brass Dragon Lairs

Brass dragons usually dwell in secret caves and canyons near well-traveled routes.
