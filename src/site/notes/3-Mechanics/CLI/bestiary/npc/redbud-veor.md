    \ except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and\
    \ they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of Redbud.\
    \ The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until Redbud dies or is\
    \ more than 120 feet from the tree; or until Redbud takes a bonus action to turn\
    \ it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible."
