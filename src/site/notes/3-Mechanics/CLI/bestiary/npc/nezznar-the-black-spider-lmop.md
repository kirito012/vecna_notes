# [Nezznar the Black Spider](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/nezznar-the-black-spider-lmop.md)
*Source: Lost Mine of Phandelver p. 59*  

Drow (dark elves) are a devious, scheming subterranean race that worships Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders.

Drow society is strictly matriarchal. Male drow are relegated to servitor roles, and while most train as warriors, a few, such as Nezznar, become skilled wizards.
