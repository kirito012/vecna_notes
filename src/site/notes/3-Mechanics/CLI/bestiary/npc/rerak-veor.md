    \ must make a DC 22 Charisma saving throw; if the target has the [unconscious](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious)\
    \ condition, it has disadvantage on this saving throw. The target takes 21 (6d6)\
    \ force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Rerak\
    \ then regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of force damage taken.\n\
    \nIf this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target immediately dies,\
    \ its body disappears, and its soul is trapped inside one of the soul gems within\
    \ Rerak's skull. After 24 hours, the gem transfers the soul to Rerak's creator.\n\
    \nWhen Rerak is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and disintegrates, leaving\
    \ behind the gems. Crushing a gem releases any souls trapped within, at which\
    \ point the soul's body re-forms in an unoccupied space nearest to the gem and\
    \ in the same state as it was when its soul was trapped."
