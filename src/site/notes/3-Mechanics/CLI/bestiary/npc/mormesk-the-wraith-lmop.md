# [Mormesk the Wraith](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/mormesk-the-wraith-lmop.md)
*Source: Lost Mine of Phandelver p. 59*  

A wraith is the incorporeal remnant of a particularly hateful being. Most wraiths can transform those they have slain into spectral undead servitors. Mormesk chooses not to, preferring to let the dead stay dead.
