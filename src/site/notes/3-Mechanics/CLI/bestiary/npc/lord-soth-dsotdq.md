# [Lord Soth](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md)
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen p. 206, Vecna: Eve of Ruin*  

Lord Soth is the most powerful death knight on Krynn. Once a Solamnic Knight of the Order of the Rose, Soth was a paragon of virtue and justice who allowed his pride to lead him down an evil path. The gods gave Soth a chance at redemption, charging him with confronting the Kingpriest of Istar and averting the Cataclysm. However, he was undone by his pride, abandoned his quest, and allowed the Cataclysm to devastate Krynn. Soth perished during the Cataclysm but then rose from the ashes as an Undead horror. In his cursed castle, Dargaard Keep, Soth long ignored the ruined world, but the Dragon Queen's summons has called his evil forth once more.

In battle, Soth is a terror, wielding the last remnant of the Cataclysm's fires to devastating effect. He usually uses his spellcasting ability only as part of his legendary actions.
