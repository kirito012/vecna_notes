# [Glaive](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/glaive-veor.md)
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 81*  

Since the Mournland's earliest days, Glaive has wielded her namesake weapon in service to the Lord of Blades' bloody conquest of the blighted region. Among the blades, Glaive is best known for her talent at self-modification. "Glaive" is etched onto the back of her neck-plate. It is the only name Glaive has ever known, and fellow blades don't dare call her anything else. Mournland adventurers, however, refer to the terrifying commander by another name: Kill Switch.
