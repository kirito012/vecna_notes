# [Tasha the Witch](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/tasha-the-witch-veor.md)
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 252*  

Tasha's path to greatness began when she was adopted by the arch-hag Baba Yaga, who named her Natasha. Tasha went on to create various spells, including Tasha's Hideous Laughter, and her magic-fueled ambitions brought her into contact with demons and demon lords, which she subjugated and used against her enemies. On the Material Plane, she became known as Iggwilv the Witch Queen and wrote the Demonomicon of Iggwilv, the greatest of all treatises on the Abyss and its demonic inhabitants. In recent years, Tasha sequestered herself in the Feywild, achieving incredible power and slowly turning into a Fey creature. Tasha became Zybilna, archfey of the domain of Prismeer.

## Answering the Summons

When Zybilna received Alustriel Silverhand's summons to combat Vecna, the archfey was sorely needed in Prismeer. As a compromise, and to honor Tasha's friendship with Alustriel, Zybilna sent a version of herself from the past to Alustriel's side. The Tasha who appears in*Vecna: Eve of Ruin*is a powerful wizard, though she is not yet a witch queen or an archfey.
