# Copper Dragon

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an adult or ancient copper dragon's lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Chatty Critters.** Tiny Beasts magically gain the ability to speak and understand Draconic while within 6 miles of the lair.  
- **Giggle Fits.** Whenever a creature other than the dragon and its allies is within 1 mile of the lair and rolls a 1 on a [D20 Test](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md), it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [Incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition until the end of its next turn, as it is wracked with laughter.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
