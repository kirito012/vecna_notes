# Shadow Dragon

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region around a shadow dragon's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Negative Energy Suffusion.** Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains [Hit Points](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) from a spell, it subtracts `1d10` from the number of [Hit Points](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) regained.  
- **Stifling Shadows.** Within 1 mile of the lair, effects that normally create [Bright Light](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) instead create [Dim Light](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md), and creatures there have [Advantage](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity ([Stealth](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
