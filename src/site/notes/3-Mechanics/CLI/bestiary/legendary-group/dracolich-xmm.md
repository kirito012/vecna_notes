# Dracolich

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a dracolich's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Sapping Mist.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [Lightly Obscured](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md) by pale fog. Whenever a creature other than the dracolich or one of its allies finishes a [Long Rest](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md) in that area, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [Exhaustion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) level.  
- **Soul Drain.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair have [Disadvantage](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on Death Saving Throws.  

If the dracolich is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. The effects resume if the dracolich gains a new body (see its Soul Gem trait).
