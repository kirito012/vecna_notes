# Blue Dragon

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an adult or ancient blue dragon's lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Sinkholes.** Sinkholes form more frequently in the area within 1 mile of the lair. Whenever a creature in that area other than the dragon and its allies finishes a [Long Rest](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md), roll `d20`. On a 1, a sinkhole opens beneath the creature, and the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall `2d4 Ã— 10` feet into the sinkhole.  
- **Spiteful Storms.** Dust devils and thunderstorms rage within 1 mile of the lair. The area is [Lightly Obscured](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md).  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
