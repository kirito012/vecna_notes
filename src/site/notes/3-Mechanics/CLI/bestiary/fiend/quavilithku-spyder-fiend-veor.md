# [Quavilithku Spyder-Fiend](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\fiend/quavilithku-spyder-fiend-veor.md)
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 236*  

Quavilithku spyder-fiends revel in destruction. Although they like to savage prey with their mangy wolf heads, they delight in destroying structures and art objectsâ€”the more beautiful, the better. The arms hanging below their wolf heads are physically frail but useful for employing tools of destruction or sabotage.

## Spyder-Fiends

Demonic beasts that combine the worst attributes of wolves and spiders, spyder-fiends scuttle about with bloated, spiderlike bodies and gnash with wolflike heads. Spyder-fiends are usually coated with gore, as brutal killing is their favorite pursuit. They spin durable webs and are ingenious in how they employ their webs against prey.

Spyder-fiends are organized into a hierarchy based on might and cunning, with higher-ranked spyder-fiends dominating lower ranks. Spyder-fiends of equivalent rank scheme against each other for advancement and eagerly turn against one another if treachery can improve their position.

Spyder-fiends loyally serve their general, Miska the Wolf-Spider. While they were rarely seen during Miska's imprisonment in Pandemonium, they have become increasingly active as Miska struggles to free himself in Pandesmos.
