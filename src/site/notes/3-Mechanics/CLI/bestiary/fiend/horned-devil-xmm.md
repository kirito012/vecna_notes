## Horned Devil

*Devil of Hatred and Subjugation*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Nine Hells)  
- **Treasure.** Relics  

Horned devils, also known as cornugons or malebranche, are infernal warriors that exact the will of diabolical generals and lead other devils in battle. Their bodies and weapons are forged in the Nine Hells, and they torment their foes with diabolical flames and pernicious wounds.
