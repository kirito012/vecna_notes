# [Relentless Impaler](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\fiend/relentless-impaler-veor.md)
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 231*  

In the Domains of Dread, practitioners of foul magic perform a profane ritual that turns living creatures into fiendish killers. This ritual necessitates the use of a ceremonial stake, which is plunged into the heart of a living sacrifice. The hulking form of the relentless impaler then emerges from the sacrifice's pool of blood, spear in hand.

A relentless impaler is bound to the creature that wielded the ceremonial stake in the ritual that birthed it. As long as the original stake remains lodged in the heart of the ritual victim, the impaler can return over and over again to regenerate beside the victim's body, no matter how many times it is destroyed.

The impaler pursues its creator's agenda coldly and efficiently. It has no concern for its own self-preservation, knowing that, for itself at least, death isn't the end.
