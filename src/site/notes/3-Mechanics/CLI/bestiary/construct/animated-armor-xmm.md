# [Animated Armor](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/animated-armor-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 16*  

Animated suits of armor might move with steady deliberateness or awkward gaits. They're often constructed from plate armor, making them easy to mistake for soldiers or helmed horrors. Other types of armor or even metal statuary might also become animated armor.

## Animated Objects

*Mundane Objects Come to Life*

- **Habitat.** Urban  
- **Treasure.** None  

Magic can manipulate mundane items, compelling them to perform simple tasks. Such animate objects might be unassuming tools or decorations that can defend their creator. These objects follow simple instructions from whatever force or magic-user created them. If left unattended, they might defend an area for ages or repeat a task until they wear out.

Roll on or choose a result from the Animated Object Catalysts table to inspire what sort of magic motivates an ambulatory item.
